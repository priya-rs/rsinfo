<p id="Ancr1">The proposed workflow is designed to take advantage of both facies modelling tools and NTG property modelling using a combined hybrid approach. The technique is operating on a relatively coarse 3D grid in which coal is captured as contiguous discrete-NTG facies (Figure 1). Generally traditional "coal" litho-facies modelling requires a high number of intra-zonal layers with thin grid cells. The NTG facies approach does not require fine layering of the 3D grid and thus significantly reduces the number of grid cells in a given model. The finished product considerably reduces simulation timing without compromising reservoir detail.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The upper unit is generally subdivided into four major seams with variable thickness (up to 14 m), these larger seams tend to split and thin down the western flank and northern nose of the plunging anticline. Flank wells drilled in areas where fluvial activity was more persistent typically show up to 20 individual seams in the Upper Baralaba interval. The lower units consist of thinner, higher ash coals with frequent tuffaceous intervals. This character can be visualized in Figure 3c where the intra-coal facies for the lower unit (Middle Baralaba) consist of a lower volume of coal per cell. The coals in the lower units are not currently target for CSG production.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Sensitivities on layering indicate that the adopted layering geometry returns a more regular volume discretization and overall better estimate of total net coal (Figure 4a); as opposed to a proportional layering geometry, which can lead to layer distortions and therefore incorrect estimation of NTG. In areas adjacent to major seam amalgamation, coal model artefacts can occur due to the sudden reduction of cell volume (Figure 4b). The number of layers adopted is arbitrary and relatively dependent upon the coal seam thicknesses. In order to achieve a fair distribution of NTG facies, the resolution of the 3D grid should be calibrated to generate a sensible amount of grid cells with 100% NTG.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">For the definition of NTG facies a discrete coal-flag log is used. Coal intervals are flagged using high resolution density logs. The identification of borehole breakout is checked, in this instance sonic logs are evaluated to aid in controlling coal intervals. The coal flag-log is upscaled in the 3D grid as a 0-1 binary array using an arithmetic averaging method. As a result of this operation a continuous NTG property is generated. Discrete NTG classes are then calculated using an arbitrary number of cut-offs (Figure 5). The more discrete coal classes defined, the smoother the NTG model. In the Permian coals of Scotia and Fairview the optimal NTG discretization was achieved with the definition of 5 to 7 classes; further refinement resulted in very small or "empty" sampling envelopes for certain facies.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Using the discrete-NTG modelling method with plentiful well control across the core of the field has allowed a robust numerical population of upscaled cells giving strong control of vertical and horizontal distribution of coals. Figure 8 illustrates the neat coalescing of seams in the central part of the field known as the "superseam". Five individual discrete-NTG facies were defined in this model to capture the coal signature, though this number can be tailored pertaining to the level of detail required. Guided by structural surfaces the facies proportion curves are used to populate the intra-well cells away from well control giving excellent spatial distribution in environments with horizontally continuous coal seams. The mesh section in Figure 8 shows the how the B and D seam thickness is maintained out towards the peripherals of the field.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">Both the Scotia and Fairview models are being used for dynamic simulation with objective of improving the accuracy and reducing uncertainty on production forecasts. Typically the Permian coals present vertical coal signatures with several (meters) thick seams with major coal splits and amalgamations. In these environments the adopted technique seems to work well returning consistent coal architectures which honour well data and reflect current geological understanding of the fields (Figure 10).</p><div id="link-10">
