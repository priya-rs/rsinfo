<p id="Ancr7">North Slope Alaska is estimated to contain 12 billion barrels of original oil in place of viscous oil in the shallow, late Cretaceous, Schrader Bluff Formation. This resource generally overlies deeper producing fields including two of the biggest fields in North America, Prudhoe Bay and Kuparuk (Figure 1). Alaska North Slope (ANS) viscous oil resource (VO) is one of the largest under-developed accumulations in North America. If even modest recoveries can be achieved (compared to light oil), potential reserves are substantial.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Detailed reviews of ANS VO resources are available (Paskvan 2016, Targac 2005). Of the estimated 12 billion barrels in place, 2.5 billion are being developed with water flooding (Figure 2). Over 150 million barrels oil have been produced to date with estimated ultimate recovery factor (RF) averaging 17% at 0.75 HCPVI at 35 years. This relatively low RF makes Alaska viscous a huge target for improving waterflood and applying enhanced oil recovery methods. Paskvan et. al. (2016) delves into the viscous resource and development history, evolution of well design, key waterflooding challenges, and geomechanical understanding that may meet these challenges.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">Play to the engineering and operational strength of BP in managing and improving waterfloods. There exists a continuum of viscosity in VO (Figure 3) ranging from less than 150 cP to more than 2000 cP. Waterflooding is the current development strategy for the lower viscosity barrels, i. e. up to 600 cP, yet WF performance to date has underperformed expectations largely due to soft sand rock failures. The first goal of the RAS is to progress undeveloped high quality viscous oil projects to execute stage. From a technical standpoint, this objective necessitated establishing reliable recovery from waterfloodable viscous oil.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The second RAS objective is to screen VO EOR options over a broad range of viscosities to improve RF by 10%. Alaska fluids range over a continuum of viscosities from light through viscous to heavy. Associated with this are continuums of technical, organizational, scientific and commercial challenges which increase as resource development progresses to heavier, more viscous oils (Figure 4). The optimal extraction technique is not only a function of viscosity, but also original oil in place (OOIP) and rock type. A description of an emerging “Quilt” of different recovery methods applied to different resource tranches is provided in Paskvan 2016.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr14">Key challenges to waterflooding Schrader Bluff are well spacing and operational practices that limit HCPVI (Paskvan 2016, Bidinger 1995). Increased flood rate is needed to realize improved oil recovery (IOR), but risks of rock failure through Matrix Bypass Events (MBEs) with increased injection and interwell gradients require improved completions using sand control. Performance of individual areas vary, but SB waterfloods (Figure 8) have an average expected recovery of 17% with 0.75 HCPVI after 35 years of injection (Paskvan 2016). The average waterflood performance of SB is very consistent with global analogs.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr29">The bulk adsorption was measured for all the surfactants. The overall surfactant adsorption is shown in (Figure 23). Adsorption values below 100 mg of surfactant per 100 g of rock would be ideal. Adsorption values above 200 mg of surfactant per 100 g of rock are economically challenging. The surfactants that had low adsorption values included Sasol S23-13S, Sasol L123, Sasol K4-13S, and OCT ORS74. In most cases, the presence of alkali dropped the surfactant adsorption level.</p><div id="link-23">

The polymer formulations consisted of 1300 ppm polymer Floopaam 3630 mixed in PC +PB brine. The waterflood recovered 33% of the original oil in place after 2.0 pore volumes injected. The subsequent polymer flood recovered another 34% OOIP after 3.5 pore volumes of polymer injected. The oil production profile and watercut for the waterflood followed by polymer flood are shown in Figure 24 as a function of pore volumes injected.</p><div id="link-24">

Waterflood reduces oil saturation from 84% to 40.3%. The first ASP coreflood reduced the oil saturation to 14.4%. Residual saturation to ASP of 14.4% is regarded as high in a sandpack coreflood and a residual of below 5% would be optimum.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr35">Polymer selection procedure is summarized in Figure 29. For this project, TIORCO polymers including EOR 380, EOR 360 and EOR 80 were screened. As should be expected, for similar concentration, higher molecular weight polymers EOR 380 and EOR 360 give the maximum viscosification compared to lower molecular weight polymer EOR80. However, the molecular weight versus permeability plot (Figure 29) clearly shows that only EOR 80 can effectively propagate through both the high permeability and low permeability sands. Higher molecular weight EOR 380 can effectively propagate through sands with permeabilities greater than 100 mD.</p><div id="link-29">

We wanted to know how far the design polymer has been able to migrate and the polymer adsorption and RRF within this region. This was to ascertain if the design polymer could be injected economically and without a substantial reduction in formation permeability. Figure 31 also shows the expected adsorption, viscosity and RRF for the test design, all important parameters to understand the sensibility of injecting design polymer in average to low permeability Schrader Bluff rock.</p><div id="link-31">

<p id="Ancr39">Field results thus far indicate additional recovery of 2% to 4% of OOIP above WF recovery from VRWAG. VRWAG also helps lifting well hydraulics, and builds-up reservoir pressure faster than water injection. Figure 33 shows viscosity and oil density reduction for a West Sak oil in a multicomponent laboratory study (Conoco Phillips internal report). Viscosity reduces from an original 60 cP to ~5 cP after 3 contacts of injectant gas (Kuparuk MI-76%C1, 6% C2 and 7+% C3+ hydrocarbons) and West Sak oil (18 API). VRWAG should be considered where a source of VRI is economically available.</p><div id="link-33">
