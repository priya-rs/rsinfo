<p id="Ancr5">Reservoir geology is a tight mixed carbonate and clastic shelf/slope sequence, with Lebada West being more sand prone and Lebada East more carbonate prone, which correlates with a proximal to distal sediment trend of West to East. The trap (Fig. 2) is mixed stratigraphic and structural that is bound in the north by a regional overthrust fault and stratigraphically pinches out to the west by erosion and facies compaction to the south.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The application of fracturing flow diversion technologies using a degradable diverting agent is a proven cost-effective alternative to mechanical isolation systems. These diverter systems are degradable, self-removing, particulate materials that, when applied in an optimal range of mesh sizing, can create an effective seal (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The application of a diversion-aided technique has demonstrated improved proppant distribution in openhole completions (Adil et al. 2014). The diverting agent can be pumped in spacers following each proppant cycle, and the particles are sized such that they create a barrier at the mouth of the fracture sufficient to withstand the pressure differentials necessary to divert that fracturing fluid and start a new fracture at another location along the wellbore (Fig. 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">Although the initial decline rate has associated uncertainties with determination because of different sections of reservoir being stimulated at different times, it is the main factor in this driver group, since this describes the initial behaviour of the reservoir when the ports were initially opened and therefore assumed to apply for the refracturing. Although SHmax is highly uncertain with conflicting evidence in the Lebada Field, it is a fundamental factor for fracture connectivity in the reservoir. Fig. 7 shows the initial weighting of decision criteria and resulting scores for the relative productivity criteria.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">For each well on this project, a production index was computed as a weighted average from multiple defined quality curves, including facies (calculated from mineral contents from the formation), brittleness, and effective porosity. The overall fracture index was then computed as a measure of closure pressure gradient. The product of a good production index and fracture index provided a sweet spot indicator along the wellbore. The overall factor to measure sweet spot potential for refracture treatment was the cumulative refracture sweet spot length (Fig. 8), which was used as one of the decision criteria to understand relative degree of drainage for all wells.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">Each decision criteria and driver was given a weight based on the knowledge gathered and biggest impacts on the potential for refracturing (Fig. 7 and Fig. 9). Relative productivity and relative degree of drainage were considered for the initial high grading of wells in a rank. Relative productivity was given a lower weight (40%) than relative degree of drainage (60%) because productivity is related to reservoir properties and production on a field scale whereas degree of drainage contains criteria applicable to refracturing success on a detailed well scale.</p><div id="link-9">

The colour indication is as follows: red=high potential risk, amber=medium potential risk, green=low potential risk.

The CBT engineered breakdown sequence was implemented to control fracture growth, support connectivity, and mitigate against excessive pressure losses and restrictions (tortuosity) between the wellbore and formation. Cycles displayed good formation response to the diverting agent because the desired increasing trend of the FGs was achieved (Fig. 19).

After a short cleanout period, well production stabilized at levels doubled in comparison to the production before stimulation. Another important indication is an increased flowing wellhead pressure of 40 bar (Fig. 21). Before stimulation, the well was producing by artificial lift; after stimulation, the well is again naturally flowing. Production monitoring continues, and results can be used for potential full field implementation.</p><div id="link-21">
