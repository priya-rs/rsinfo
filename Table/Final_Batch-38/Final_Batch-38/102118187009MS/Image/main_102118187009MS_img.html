<p id="Ancr1">Core data also indicate that there is a tidal influence in some of the thicker sandstone bodies, particularly in their upper portions. Prior interpretations include a distributary channel origin (Young et al., 1991) and poinnt bar deposition associated with a meandering fluvial channel (Smith et al., 1995). As with th 34-1 sand, the 33-series reservoir occurs interbedded with mudstone and thin carbonates. (Carter et al., 2003). The 33 Series in the WW B-10 core comprises a fine-grained sandstone body containing mudstone clasts, carbonaceous laminae and flaser bedding (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

Average water cut before pump repair job was 84% WC (154 bopd, 982 bfpd), and average water cut after pump repair job was 91.5% WC 25 bopd, 1233 bfpd). This condition made the production of this well decrease about 125 bopd (Figure 10).
