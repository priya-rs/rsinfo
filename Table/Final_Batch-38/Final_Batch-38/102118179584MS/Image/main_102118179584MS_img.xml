<anchoringText id="Ancr10">A sandpack flooding set-up was used in the experiments as shown in Figure 1. To evaluate the blocking capacity of foams, only formation water (salinity of 15,000 -30,000 mg/L) was saturated in the sandpack tubes. Pressure drops across the sandpack were measured during water and foam injection for FR against water flooding.</anchoringText>

The data shows that the water cut during foam flooding was smaller than that of water flooding when the injected pore volume (PV) of fluid was less than 2 PV, which indicates that foam injection can effectively reduce the mobility of water and may extend the duration of water flooding.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr13">Flooding experiments in three parallel tubes The schematic diagram of the three parallel tubes (sandpack) model is shown in Figure 4, which was used to simulate the effect of reservoir heterogeneity on water and foam flooding. The three tubes were packed with different sands and connected in parallel to simulate the interlayer heterogeneity of the real reservoir. The conformance control capability of foams can be tested in the experiments, and the experimental conditions is described in Table 5.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr14">The experimental results are shown in Figure 5, in which foams generated with FS-3 and Enhanced-V agent system are compared in terms of water cut, differential pressure and oil recovery efficiency for both cases. The data shown in the figure were accounted from the sums of the three tubes in total. It is notable that, for both cases, the water cut measured increased to around 95% after the first 3PVs of water injection, and then it started to decrease following the first 1PV foam injection.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr17">The measured differential pressures across the three tubes are shown in Figure 8. The data displays that, during the foam injection, the differential pressure increased steadily in the cases with gas/liquid ratio of 1:1, 2:1 and 3:1, and the highest was achieved when the gas/liquid ratio was 1:1, indicating that the most stable foam can be formed when the gas/liquid ratio was 1:1.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr20">The SZ field pilot of foam injection involved 2 injection wells (wells F17 and F26 marked in blue as shown in Figure 11) and 13 oil production wells (marked in red and yellow in the central box of Figure 11). The detailed field operation has been described elsewhere (Xu et al., 2014; Ma et al., 2013). Before the implementation of nitrogen foam injection, the average water cut was over 68%, and the oil recovery factor was less than 15%. As described above, the performance of water flooding was poor due to the problem of interlayer heterogeneity.</anchoringText>
