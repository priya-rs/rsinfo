<p id="Ancr4">The target production formation, T-Unit, is located within the Lower Saramacca member of the Saramacca Formation in the stratigraphic column of the coastal plain of Suriname (Haskell et al. 2010). The formation is sedimentary and young geologically. The available evidence indicates that in the study area compaction is the dominate drive mechanism with a possibility of very weak water influx from the cretaceous Nickerie formation, located at the bottom of the T-Unit (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Fig. 3 illustrates the simulation model that was built with 3-D heterogeneous grid blocks 15 × 15 × 1 in x, y, and z directions based on a well pattern from the Tambaredjo polymer flooding pilot project. For an average grid block in the T unit, dx = 28.804 m (94.5 ft), dy = 18.147 m (59.54 ft), dz = 10.88 m (35.71 ft). However, each grid block had a unique thickness in the z-direction. The average well spacing between injector and producer (in the simulation model) was 139.8 m (459 ft). A five-spot well pattern consisted of one injector (labeled I1 and corresponding to actual injector, 1M101), and four producers: P1, P2, P3, and P4—corresponding to actual producers 1M051, 1M09, 1M10, and 1N06, respectively.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">Incremental oil recovery from waterflooding and polymer flooding was significantly less after primary production from a compaction drive than when no significant compaction drive occurred—simply because the oil recovery target was less. This point is illustrated in Fig. 4, where for a given circumstance when compressibility was 5.6x10-4 psi-1, the incremental oil recovery was roughly half the value for compressibility of 1 × 10-6 psi-1. In particular, after 22 years of 125-cp polymer flooding, cumulative incremental oil production over the compaction drive was 43.9% OOIP with compressibility of 1 × 10-6 psi-1 versus 23.6% OOIP with compressibility of 5.6 × 10-4 psi-1.</p><div id="102118185851MS-Img_SPi-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Fig. 5 provides water cuts associated with the curves in Fig. 4. For primary production with compressibility of 1×10-6 psi-1, water cut remained below 5% for the entire 39-year production history (bottom thick curve with no symbols in Fig. 5). In contrast, for primary production with compressibility of 5.6×10-4 psi-1, water cut gradually rose to 56% (upper thin curve with no symbols). As explanation for the latter observation, even though the water saturation may have been distributed evenly throughout the reservoir at the time of discovery, water moved preferentially toward production wells during the compaction drive (leaving higher saturations of the viscous oil far from the wells).</p><div id="link-5">

In this figure, Well P4 showed the greatest response, while Wells P1 and P3 provided the least incremental oil (for both compressibility values). In comparing Figs. 9 and 10, the polymer flood displaced oil towards Well P4 in preference to Well P1 (relative to the waterflood behavior). From Year 20 onward in Fig. 10, incremental oil (relative to compaction) in Well P1 (black curve and black circles) actually decreased for both compressibility values—again, demonstrating that the polymer pushed oil away from Well P1.</p><div id="link-10">

In this figure, Well P4 showed the greatest response, while Wells P1 and P3 provided the least incremental oil.

In later years (Years 30-40) for the high-compressibility case, this effect was great enough to make the cumulative oil production from Well P1 greater during waterflooding than during polymer flooding (solid black circles in Fig. 11).</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr23">Figs. 20 and 21 compare pressures throughout the pattern during polymer injection and continued compaction, respectively. In both cases, pressures were fairly uniform throughout the pattern. Pressures in Fig. 21 were reasonably consistent with pressures observed in the Tambaredjo pilot project before the start of polymer injection in 2008. However, pressures in Fig. 20 (~950 psi) are much higher than actual pilot pressures observed in 2013-2014 (less than 500 psi in shut-in producers). A key reason for the difference is that a no flow boundary was imposed around the pattern during the simulations. In contrast, responses from production wells outside the real pilot project area clearly indicated that a significant volume of the injected polymer flowed outside the pilot area </p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr25">To this point, the voidage replacement ratio averaged unity during our simulations. (Voidage replacement ratio is the ratio of injected fluid volume to produced fluid volume.) During additional studies, the effect of voidage replacement ratio on flood performance was examined. For cases of waterflooding after compaction, Fig. 22 plots oil recovery versus time for voidage replacement ratios from 0.1 to 10 (in addition to VRR=0 associated with no flood). Figs. 23 to 25 plot similar data for 45-cp, 85-cp, and 125-cp polymer flooding after compaction. Oil recovery increased with increased voidage replacement ratio for waterflooding and generally decreased with increased voidage replacement ratio for polymer flooding.</p><div id="link-22">
