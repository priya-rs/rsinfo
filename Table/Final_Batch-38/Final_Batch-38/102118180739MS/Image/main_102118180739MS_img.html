<p id="Ancr4">The Tambaredjo oil field is the largest oil field in Suriname and has been producing since 1982. The field contains approximately 525 MMSTB STOOIP of 16° API oil. The field is located in the marshy coastal area of Suriname, 55 km west of the capital city Paramaribo (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The reservoir is the T-sand, part of the Lower Saramacca Member of the Saramacca formation of Paleocene age (Figure 2). It is composed of vertically stacked sand bodies deposited in a fluvial- estuarine and shallow marine environment and is encountered at depths varying from 900 to 1,400 ft (375– 425 m)(Kartoredjo, et al. 2006). The main depositional direction is North-South. The reservoir is dipping towards the north and is limited by an edge aquifer in that direction; to the south the sands are pinching out which constitutes a stratigraphic trap. Several fault systems are present over the field.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The T1 sand is the main reservoir and was deposited in braided streams as an incised valley fill; the reservoir is composed of unconsolidated sands, fine to coarse, poorly to well-sorted, of high porosity (33%average) and very high permeability of 3 to over 10 Darcies. Reservoir heterogeneity is relatively high due to the depositional environment and the Dykstra-Parsons coefficient is 0.78. Maximum reservoir thickness can reach up to 45 ft.

<p id="Ancr8">Polymer was initially injected in the 1M101 injection well (from September 2008); in view of the results a second, adjacent pattern (1N062) was added in May 2010 then a third one (1M052) in June 2011. Thus the pilot is composed of three injection wells and 9 production wells in three unconfined inverted 5-spot patterns (Figure 5). All the wells are vertical. Due to the shape of the patterns the distance between injection and production wells varies between 275 ft and 540 ft (85 m to 165 m).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">Injection rates varied between 150–450 bbl/d/injection well (Figure 7). As discussed by Moe Soe Let et al.(Moe Soe Let, Manichand and Seright 2012) a viscosity of 40–45 cp was initially injected in the pilot. However subsequent analysis suggested that a better sweep efficiency could be achieved by increasing the injected polymer viscosity thus viscosity was first increased to 85 cp (in November-December 2011) then to 125 cp in February 2013 (Figure 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">In total 6 out of the 9 wells in the pilot patterns responded favorably to polymer injection. For instance, well 1N06 (1M101 and 1N062 patterns) experienced an increase in oil rate from approximately 5 bopd at the start of the pilot to almost 17 bopd (Figure 8); the pressure response is evidenced by the increase in fluid rate from 20 bbl/d to 50 bbl/d. It must be noted however that water-cut did not decrease but rather increased progressively up to almost 90% during the course of the pilot. The best response was observed in well 1I25 (1M052 pattern) with an increase in oil rate from 5 bopd to 25 bopd (Figure 9)</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr13">Both wells 1N11 from pattern 1N062 and 1N01 (the latter outside of the polymer patterns) experienced severe water breakthrough and had to be shut-in later on. Figure 10 shows the production history of well 1N11 and the increase in water-cut experienced at the end of 2010, approxi-mately 6 months after the beginning of injection in well 1N062. The water-cut in the well exceeded 90%within a few months.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">The polymer injection patterns are unconfined by nature so it came as no surprise that part of the injected fluid leaked outside the patterns. However, the very strong response recorded in some of the wells far from the pilot patterns was not expected. For instance, well 1M13 located at 1,400 ft from the pilot saw its oil rate increase from approximately 5 bopd at the beginning of the pilot to 14 bopd (Figure 11); this increase in rate was accompanied by a reduction in water-cut from approximately 92% at the beginning of the pilot down to 61%.</p><div id="link-11">
