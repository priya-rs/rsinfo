Nearest seaports are located in the city of Astrakhan (175 km) and in Makhachkala, Kizlyar and Derbent. The Yu. Korchagin field is the first field put into operation in the Caspian sea. It was discovered in 2000 by drilling of well No. 1-Shirotnaya, and put into production operation in 2010. Oil</p><div id="link-1">

The Neocom formation's GOC and WOC is located at -1517 m and 1537 m respectively. Effective thickness of the oil rim has considerable gas and water-oil transition zones and is characterized with heterogeneity of filtration properties (table 1).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr14">During one-year period of well operation in constant steady state, recurrent studies with samples collection for laboratory analyses have been performed. In steady state the tracer discharge into the target fluid is constant. In theory, cumulative mass of released tracer should be constantly growing (dashed line in Fig. 12). Based on the tracer concentrations detected in samples and well performance, cumulative curve of tracer release is drawn for each tracer rod. Deviation of the cumulative tracer release curve from the theoretical line means that lingered fluid with tracer has been recovered (increase of tracer release) or that tracer rod has had less contact with target fluid (decrease of tracer release).</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr15">(1) High increase of tracer release in zone 7 happened during switching to minimum choke (7.94 mm), which shows that fluid with tracer has lingered in the wellbore when standard choke was used, and that this fluid with tracer has been flushed out due to increased inflow in zone 7 at low pressure drawdown. At the same time, tracer flushing-out from zones 1 and 2 is reduced when the minimum choke is used, (2) inflow from zones 1 and 2 resumes after switching to a larger choke (9.52 mm) (Fig. 13).</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr18">The tracer responses demonstrate that initial stage of the transient flow state after the well startup is characterized by unstable bottom-hole pressure and show distorted tracer responses with multiple peaks, which in their turn may indicate the adjustment of ICDs to the working parameters (pressure balancing and gas inflow restriction) (Fig. 16). The splitting-up of the signal peaks may indicate that fluid is not static when the well is shut-in, i.e. some flow between the zones may take place.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr19">Steady responses from all tracer systems have been detected, and it confirms that inflow takes place in all zones where tracer rods are installed. Single and multiple spikes of signals during the initial period after the well startup indicate high inflow of oil and gas mixture, further stabilization and smooth decrease of signals indicates that the inflow was restricted by AICDs. Relatively small amplitude and distorted form of signal from the tracer rod in zone 4 show that there was a significant inflow of gas or water. The results of quantitative assessment of the inflow profile are given in Fig. 17.</p><div id="link-17">
