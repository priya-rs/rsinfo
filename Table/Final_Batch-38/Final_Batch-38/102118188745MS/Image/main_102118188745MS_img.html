<p id="Ancr6">The presence of faults and lineaments in the overburden and reservoir intervals and the possible effect on successful delivery of any planned well is often a cause for concern. For Well#1 as show in Figure 1a below, due to seismically observed disturbed overburden zone along well path, possible mud-losses and overburden pipe sticking was predicted. PDA indicate the prediction to be accurate as pipe sticking, partial and complete mud losses were encountered at locations corresponding to the disturbed zone observed from seismic. Within the reservoir interval, one lineament with associated seismic hump was interpreted near end of lateral section for the planned wellbore.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">The geological aspects of the PDA workflow are summarized in Figure 3 below. Among others, the key elements for consideration include geologic property distribution around the new drill region, data coverage, gaps and quality, and possible impact on forthcoming wells. Figure 3a1 is reservoir X kh map showing Well#1 and some offset wells. Tracer injection has been conducted in some nearby base wells, as denoted by the yellow polygons and the pink arrows which indicate tracer travel path. From integrated data analysis, the inferred direction of water movement is also shown by the blue arrows. Figure 3a2 show post-drill interpretation of porosity and water saturation of Wells#1, while Figure 3a4 shows the well path along reservoir Y cross section.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">The base maps in Figures 4a and 4b show the structure contours of reservoirs Y and Z respectively with well test kh in the background. The maps indicate significant heterogeneity in kh especially for reservoir Z. Fault traces are shown in the map and consist of a variety of segmented fault orientations (dominantly NW-SE, but also NE-SW subordinates). In addition to the base offset wells draining the same patterns and sectors, the PDA wells are also shown with well paths denoted in red color.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">Another useful addition to the PDA workflow is the generation of arbitrary section across all wells targeting the same pattern as the candidate PDA wells. For instance, the chart at the top of Figure 5a is an E-W section extracted from the base map at the bottom of the figure. The section traverses all the wells in close proximity to Well#1 in reservoir Y. The reservoir zones are demarcated by the horizontal lines, while the time stamps below the section indicate the spud and workover dates respectively. The red colored star polygon indicate the position of the PDA well (Well#1) Vis a Vis other wells across the section. The wells have been color marked to indicate their status either as producers or injectors (green represents producers while blue is for injectors).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">The candidate wells passed through the various stages of WDP comprising technical and commercial components. Learning from drilling and completion is crucial in building the body of knowledge required for enhancement of future well campaigns. Figures 7a &amp; 7b summarize the key events resulting from drilling Wells#1&amp;#2 respectively. The challenges encountered for Well#1 was mainly operational due to drilling equipment issues which resulted in extension of planned drilling duration. While some dynamic mud losses was recorded in the over burden, the learnings were captured and documented to be utilized in improving future drilling operations.</p><div id="link-7">
