<p id="Ancr10">First, we plotted the scatter plot of the best 3-month gas rate versus lateral length in a violin plot (Fig. 4). A clear distribution can be seen based on the grouping of lateral lengths, and it seems to display an increasing trend. However, we must be cautious. The number of wells in the 8,000 to 12,000 ft group is much less than the number of wells in the &lt;8,000-ft group. Nevertheless, the maximum rate seems to increase for longer lateral length wells. This raises the question of whether there is a sweet spot in terms of lateral length.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr11">Superimposing total proppant volume by total fluid injection (lb/gal, shown as bubbles) onto a violin plot does not show much of a difference because most of the ratio data are in the 0.5 to 50 range (Fig. 5). This needs to be investigated further, but there is no critical observation that can be made for the entire field. Similarly, the number of fracturing stages versus lateral length was investigated in a violin plot (Fig. 6). Another display that is useful is the superposition of gross interval onto the lateral length violin plot (Fig. 7). We suspect that gross interval is directly proportional to longer lateral length because more reservoir is in contact with the well.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr16">Fig. 10 indicates well production increases almost linearly as horizontal lateral length increases. Note that this comes with the assumptions of same quality rock and same completion quality in the additional lateral sections. Although the trend looks like a linear relationship in Fig. 10, we can observe variations in the increase in oil production (column 4 in Table 4) with different lateral length cases. For example, increasing the lateral length from 10,080 ft to 11,280 ft only resulted in an oil production increase of 133 bbl, but increasing the lateral length from 13,680 ft to 14,480 ft increased the accumulated oil production by 512 bbl.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr17">Fig. 11 illustrates the transient flowing behavior of the wells. It shows the trends in wellhead liquid flow rate for the shortest and longest lateral lengths. Both the shortest well and the longest well show slugging behaviors after 9 days simulation time. However, with a longer lateral and more fracture clusters, the 17,280-ft lateral well started with a much higher initial stable rate and was still producing at the end of the 17-day simulation period in contrast to the 4,168-ft lateral well.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr18">We can see that the oil production increase per 1,200-ft lateral increase is declining from 1214 bbl to 670 bbl. This is because a higher rate results in higher pressure drop along the long lateral, which suppresses the reservoir inflow from the clusters close to the toe. We can see the same trend in Fig. 12. The trendline of the results can be fit to a linear curve. However, it is better described as a polynomial curve. This shows that in this scenario, the change in production increase declines as lateral length becomes longer.</p><div id="link-12">
