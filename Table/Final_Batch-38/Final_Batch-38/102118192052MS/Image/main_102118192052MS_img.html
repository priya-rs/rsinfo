<p id="Ancr7">The Vashishta and S1 gas fields (Fig. 1) are located in the Krishna-Godavari (KG) Offshore basin, off the east coast of India; these fields are being developed as a deepwater project by India's largest operator. The Vashishta field lies in water depths ranging from 500 to 700 m; the S1 field is located in water depths ranging from 250 to 600 m. The Vashishta field is a free-gas field with estimated reserves of 12920 MMscm. The block occupies an area of 119 m2 and lies to the south of the G-1 field.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Krishna Godavari basin (Fig. 2) is an extensive deltaic plain formed by two large east coast rivers, Krishna and Godavari, in the state of Andhra Pradesh and the adjoining areas of Bay of Bengal, in which these rivers discharge their water. The Krishna Godavari basin is a proven petroliferous basin of continental margin located on the east coast of India. Its onland portion covers an area of 15,000 km2; the offshore portion covers an area of 25,000 km2. The basin contains sediments of approximately 5 km thick, with several cycles of deposition, ranging in age from Late Carboniferous to Pleistocene.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr11">Particular attention was given to minimizing the destabilization of these high clay content formations. An ultralow molecular weight cationic organic polymer (PC-4) was spearheaded (Fig. 5) into the reservoirs to provide long-term water sensitivity protection by rendering water-swelling clays insensitive to changes in water salinity, resulting in excellent sustained permeabilities.</p><div id="link-5">

As the clay stabilizer leaks off into the formation matrix and absorbs onto the fracture surface, its concentration depletes and may be insufficient to protect the clay minerals from swelling at a later stage. This treatment was changed, and a high concentration of an ultralow molecular weight cationic organic polymer (PC-4) was spearheaded into the reservoirs (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr14">Regained permeability (Lipton and Burnett 1976) testing was performed with Berea cores; the permeability of these cores ranged from 522 to 818 mD. The tests were designed to simulate the inflow of the polymer solution into the reservoir rock with subsequent backflow from the reservoir into the wellbore. The test results indicated that xanthan and HEC (Fig. 8) provided the greatest permeability gains, as compared to other polymers, providing least damage to the formation.</p><div id="link-8">
