<p id="Ancr3">Advances in asphaltene science have led to the resolution of the molecular and colloidal structures that can exist in crude oils for geologic time. Figure 1 shows the three species routinely found in reservoir crude oils; these three species are referred to as the Yen-Mullins model of asphaltenes. (Mullins et al, 2007; Mullins et al, 2010; Mullins et al 2012) Asphaltene molecules predominantly have a core aromatic structure with peripheral alkanes.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Figure 3 shows a schematic of reservoir fluid geodynamics. To understand important concerns of reservoirs listed on the right such as connectivity, GOR gradients, heavy oil formation, and tar mats, it is highly desirable to understand how the oil columns came to be. In a geology context, it is important to understand the deposition setting (e.g. turbidites, carbonate platform, near shore facies) and the "geodynamics" of the formation post deposition. Treating fluids, the same way, petroleum system modeling provides the timing, type and volume of fluids charging into the reservoir. RFG accounts for redistribution of these fluids, and their phase changes, during and post charge. RFG resolves an important shortcoming in reservoir evaluation.

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 6C indicates that most of the reservoir has equilibrated asphaltenes; this indicates that this large portion of the reservoir is likely connected. This is consistent with over one year of production data from the field. Large fluid flow is generally required in the reservoir to have equilibrated asphaltenes. (Mullins et al, 2017a) Points off the equilibrium curve are likely not connected, points 5 and 15. Point 5 is located on the extreme left flank of the field while point 15 is on the right flank of the field. Figure 6D shows the preferred thermal maturity analysis using the ratio Ts/(Ts+Tm). (Peters et al, 2005) Ts is 18α(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane, Tm is 17α(H)-22,29,30-trisnorhopane. At high temperature kerogen catagenesis (producing a more mature crude oil), there is a great fraction of the more stable structural isomer Ts compared to Tm; a mnemonic is s for stable, m for metastable.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">Pressure equilibration is a necessary but insufficient condition for flow connectivity. Only small mass transfers are necessary to equilibrate pressure. Fluid equilibration requires extensive fluid flow in reservoirs, thus is a more robust indication of flow connectivity. Fig. 7A shows the excess pressure plot for this oilfield. All wells except one overlay indicating possible connectivity. The 16/1-9 well has an excess pressure off trend by about one bar. This is a large offset; however, it is about equal to the maximum expected error so this pressure offset is not conclusively indicating the lack of connectivity for this well. The only DFA station in this well (#158 in Figs. 5 and 6) is consistent with connectivity.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">The GOR gradient is shown in Fig. 7B. The downhole and lab GOR measurements are consistent with equilibration and connectivity, within the relatively large error of GOR measurements. As shown in Fig. 7A, all the crude oils are essentially in a single pressure gradient, thus all oils degassed to roughly equivalent extents. The GOR gradient reflects this similar outgassing. Compositions are shown in Fig. 8. As with GOR, the fraction of light ends is dictated to be similar for these similar crude oils as they all outgassed to the same pressure regime. There is a small quantity of CO2 in the reservoir as shown in Fig. 8B, and as with other light ends, it is rather homogeneous and consistent with equilibrium.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">Figure 10 compares the lighter liquid components of the eight samples listed in Table 1 from the six wells. It is evident that the extent of biodegradation is very similar in all the samples. In particular, sample #15 with triple the asphaltene content, and sample #5 with half the asphaltene content compared to all other samples have very similar levels of biodegradation. The differences in asphaltene content are due to thermal maturity variations as discussed earlier, not due to different levels of biodegradation. Asphaltene content does change by a factor of 3 in going from no biodegradation, PM rank=0, to severe biodegradation, PM rank=6, because the microbes can consume ~2/3 of the crude oil. (Head et al, 2003) For these crude oils, the differences in biodegradation are slight.</p><div id="link-10">

Sample 8 shows the smallest <i>n</i>-heptane peak, so is slightly more biodegraded and is the closest to the oil-water contact (OWC). (Betancourt et al, 2018) Samples #5 and #15 are isolated; nevertheless, exhibit the same degree of biodegradation as the connected sands. This indicates that biodegraded oil charged into this reservoir as opposed have the bulk of the bulk of biodegradation within this reservoir.</figcaption>

<figcaption><b>Figure 11 </b> Core images of the reservoir section for well 16/1-21_S. Core UV-induced fluorescence is obtained in the zones indicated to have oil by petrophysical analysis. The net-to-gross values for the reservoir section is less than unity; equilibration of fluid components requires more than just vertical displacement; lateral displacement is also required increasing requisite distances.</figcaption>

<p id="Ancr14">The cores in Fig. 12 and 13 do not exhibit any asphaltene deposition, obviating concern with potential pernicious effects of asphaltene deposition. When the crude oil has a low content of asphaltenes, there can be concern that a process such as gas charging into the oil knocked the asphaltenes out of the oil leading to deposition in the reservoir. (Pfeiffer et al, 2016) In the case herein, the crude oil is high maturity (Fig. 6D), thus the crude oil started with little asphaltene content. In addition, the crude oils #5 and #15 shows expected trends of asphaltene content with maturity, consistent with a lack of alteration from an RFG process destabilizing the asphaltenes.</p><div id="link-12">
