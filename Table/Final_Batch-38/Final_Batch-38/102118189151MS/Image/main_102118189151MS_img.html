<p id="Ancr5">NAMUB Field is a brown field (with approximately 47 years of production) located in the Niger Delta. The Field discovered in 1957 with first oil (NAMB001) achieved in 1971. It is a South-West –North East trending rollover anticline bounded to the North by a major growth fault. The field is dissected by a number of smaller synthetic and antithetic faults which occur at the crest and towards the South-Western part of the field (Figure 1). Hydrocarbons have been found between depths of 7,500 ftss and 12,800 ftss in a stacked series of anticlinal or dip and fault bounded structures.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">All the shut-in oil wells were screened to know those that have pressure decline above 50%. This was done with the view that reservoirs with significant pressure decline above 50%, will likely not be able to realize their reserves any longer irrespective of Gaslift assistance. There are forty-four shut in oil conduits in the field which were drilled to develop twelve reservoirs. Ten reservoirs are in the main block and two in the northern block. The bar chart (Figure 3) captures their initial reservoir pressures, current pressures and percentage (%) pressure decline.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">Material Balance (MBAL) was used for this evaluation. The evaluation also took into consideration the inter-reservoir communication in the E-sands. This was done by utilizing multitank scenarios, thus further providing robustness in the evaluation results. This can be seen in the Multi-tank MBAL architecture (Figure 4)</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr19">The economic evaluation incorporated the reserves, incremental resource volume, Gaslift line/flowline costs and ancilliary costs to resuscitate the wells. The worst case scenario well was used to demonstrate its viability (Figure 15). This is because once the well with the lowest volume/ highest cost ranks as viable, it means that all the other wells are economically viable.</p><div id="link-15">
