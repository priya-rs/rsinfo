<p id="Ancr2">Six wells with an average depth of 12500 ft. md were drilled during 2015. Each well provided valuable data, information and knowledge to be used for each new well in the campaign, including one delineation well that was sidetracked after missing the target. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the production performance.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Well drilling costs were dramatically reduced, mainly by eliminating one phase (Figure 3). One well was sidetracked after stuck drill pipe due to differential sticking linked to high mud weight. The problem was solved by employing a new mud system chemistry, improved hydraulics, and redesigned BHA. These innovations avoided the use of a robust casing design in favor of a slimmer wells. This new setup is now a best practice in similar cases in the Llanos basin.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The initial well productivity was greatly enhanced (Figure 4) by the use of an underbalanced perforating technique, which practically eliminated the skin damage resulting from the perforation process. This is now a best completion practice in similar cases in the deep foreland Llanos basin.</p><div id="link-4">
