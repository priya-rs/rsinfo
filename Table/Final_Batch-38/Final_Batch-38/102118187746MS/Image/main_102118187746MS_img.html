<p id="Ancr3">A pilot project on construction of two long horizontal wells was implemented in 2015 (well A and well B). To solve the above-mentioned issues a decision was made to test new completion technologies for these horizontal wells. Figure 3 shows the profiles of these wells. These wells are horizontal wells with a J-shaped profile with a horizontal end and are 1067 m and 1024 m long respectively. At the same time, the spatial intensity does not exceed 1.5g/10 m till PK1 formation, and does not exceed 1g/10m in the geonavigation mode along the target part of PK1 formation.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The lower completion for well A is shown in Figure 4. Two technologies are used to fight against solid particles production: 114 mm multilayer sand screens and gravel packing. Also, the completion includes circulating screens that allow you to create the necessary path of circulation of the carrier brine to create an alpha -wave when gravel packing. A valve was installed inside the circulation screens to insulate the circulation screens after the gravel packing and thus to direct all flows of formation fluids exclusively through the sand screens.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">When the gas passes through the inlet of the control device, the pressure on the disk surface on the flow side is reduced due to the high gas flow velocity. The resultant force acting on the disk shifts it to the inlet, which reduces the flow. When a viscous fluid passes through the inlet, friction losses increase. The force constraining the disk to move to the inlet is decreased, and the inflow is intensified. As a result, more viscous fluids pass through the control device with less resistance compared to less viscous fluids (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr13">This patented model was verified in a flow-loop test and has demonstrated good practical results. Figure 13 illustrates the mathematical calculations of the model. The fluid inflow from the reservoir in the zone where the intelligent chemical marker system is installed is directly proportional to the k-coefficient of the intelligent chemical marker “charge” concentration decay curve. For a quantitative estimate of the inflow, a Flushout signal is modelled for every measured signal of the indicator system that is as close to the measured value as possible.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr22">K-coefficients defining the relative linear (per one meter of the length or per one filter with the inflow control devices) performance (inflow) in each monitoring point are normalized in relation to the K6 coefficient with the highest performance, which is taken as a unit (K6 = 1.0). Further, for each interval observed, these coefficients are reduced to the interval length according to the number of filters in each zone (Figure 17). Thus, the inflow values for each zone containing the inflow indicators are presented in relation to (normalized) the most productive interval 5 (Figure 22).</p><div id="link-22">
