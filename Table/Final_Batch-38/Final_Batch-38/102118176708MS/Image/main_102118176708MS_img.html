<p id="Ancr1">The development fields are located in Northwestern Romania. Production was started in 1960 and in 1964 in-situ combustion and cyclic steam became the predominant extraction methods (Carcoana and al [1] 1990). As of 2012 there were 2994 wells drilled including 567 active producers and the current recovery factor is 50.95%. The wells that were instrumented for this paper are located in the Lesmir area (Fig. 1) which is in the Pannonian sands of the stratigraphy.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The objective of this pilot is to capture in real-time high resolution accurate downhole thermal and pressure profiles from these two wells during steam injection, soaking, and production cycles. The two horizontal wells are drilled in a heavy and very viscous oil reservoir with the trajectory to allow flowing from toe to heel as shown in Fig. 2. Additional information resulting from petrophysical and mud-log reports confirmed the well ran through carbonate rock for over two thirds the length of the horizontal slotted liner.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The subsurface monitoring system consists of high-density array temperature sensors (ATS) and a pressure temperature gauge. These Fiber-Bragg Grating (FBG) elements are imprinted into the core of an optical fiber by an ultraviolet photo inscription process. Each element is a periodic modulation of the refractive index of a small portion of the core of the fibre as shown in Fig. 3. A broadband light is directed down the optical fibre, the first grating element produces a narrow band reflection whose wavelength is proportional to the modulation of the refractive index.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The sensor processed optical fiber is integrated within a ¼ inch (0.625 mm) capillary of various types of metallurgy and structures and lengths to complete the ATS instrument string in Fig. 4. The ATS type instrument strings can be installed in injector, producer, infill, wedge, and observation wells. There are numerous methods to deploy the ATS instrument string in the well. It can be inserted into coil tubing at surface and then the coil is placed in the well. Torque and drag studies are performed to determine the specifications of the tubing to simplify insertion into the well.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Two HASD wells (X and Y) were equipped with a fiber-optics instrumentation string encapsulated in a ¼ inch capillary. The instrumentation string was equipped with multiple ATS thermal sensors and a PT gauge at the tip. Both followed the generic well completion described in Fig. 5. In the production cycle, the 9-5/8 inch production casing extends to the heel of the well and contains a 3.5 inch pumping line up to heel; a 7 inch liner extending to the toe which contains a 1.5 inch tubular landed at the toe containing the ATS instrumentation string over the entire length of the well.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">We present the results of the real-time sub-surface monitoring system for a period of eight months from late August 2014 to late April 2015. Although the monitoring system captures the thermal and pressure profiles for each ATS sensor every second, we will present a subset of the data by using one reading per day. During this period, each of the two wells completed one HASD steam stimulation cycle and continued to the production phase for this time frame. Fig. 7 shows the response of the single pressure and temperature sensor collocated in the PT gauge at the tip of each instrument string.</p><div id="link-8">

The steam stimulation phase ends on February 14. On February 15, there is a drop in the direct measurement of the temperature sensor located in the PT gauge corresponding with a similar drop in the saturation temperature calculated from the measured pressure in the PT gauge, as the stimulation process is winding down.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">Fig. 11 depicts the winding down of the stimulation on February 15. The energy transferred to the reservoir between two sensors equals the sum of the latent and specific heat drop that can be determined using the flow rate, the heat capacity of the condensed steam and the temperature drop reported by the two sensors. Variations to the incoming steam must be taken into account along with deviations in the well trajectory and potential heavy oil dripping that may affect local and instantaneous temperature around the sensors.</p><div id="link-12">
