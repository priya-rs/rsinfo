<p id="Ancr2">The acreage position outlined in Fig. 1 has experienced three primary step modifications in terms of completion design in recent years, with each step modification resulting in incremental recovery for the development wells. These step modifications increased the completion intensity applied to each well with the first-generation treatment consisting of 1,500 lbm of proppant placed per foot of wellbore lateral and the second and third generations consisting of 2,500 lb and 3,600 lbm, respectively.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Through demonstration of this increase in well recovery by implementing more aggressive completion designs, the opportunity to workover the existing PDP wells for additional reserves posed an alternate method to increase asset value in addition to new well development. Refracturing the legacy-producing wells to bridge the gap in completion inadequacy that exists in contrast to the current well completions (Fig.2) can add increased reserves to these existing wells.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Prejob hydraulic modeling is used to estimate pumping pressure and to help ensure the cement treatment can be successfully placed without exceeding the capabilities of the surface equipment. Because of the small annular clearance, a small increase in fluid viscosity can greatly increase pumping pressure during the treatment. Fig. 3 compares predicted pumping pressure between a conventional 14.5-lbm/gal slurry design and the current 14.5-lbm/gal proprietary latex-based design used for a typical Eagle Ford cemented casing-in-casing well design.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The production results from these refracture treatments have yielded economic returns. In comparison to the bullhead refracture treatments pumped in the same area, the production results are larger in magnitude, more consistent, and generate a larger ROR. Fig. 4 shows the production increase on one well that has been recompleted with the casing-in-casing refracturing technique. Post-refracture rates yielded more than a 17-times increase compared to the prerefracture flowing rates. </p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Fig. A-1 details one wellbore layout present in this area that consists of 7-in. casing in the vertical section with a 4.5-in. production liner throughout the curve and lateral. One of the goals for constructing this new refracturing wellbore is to allow the largest ID possible in the new wellbore design to have the least amount of impact on limiting the refracturing treatment rate. Because of this, a 5.5-in. production casing string in the vertical with a crossover to 3.5-in. casing inside the original 4.5-in. liner can be used to provide a large ID in the vertical section (Fig. A-2).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Excess cement volumes for these casing-in-casing operations have ranged from 0 to 25% excess of calculated volume. The top of cement is validated using the cement bond log, and therefore the volume efficiency for the operation is also validated; necessary adjustments on excess volumes can be made accordingly on subsequent wells. Fig. A-3 depicts a cement bond log from an Eagle Ford casing-in-casing well where the top of cement is verified to be above the crossover point located at the top of the wellbore kickoff point.</p><div id="link-7">
