<p id="Ancr2">Barrow Island (BWI) is situated in the northern Carnarvon Basin, 56 km from the coast of Western Australia (Fig. 1). The island spans 27 km NS x 11.5 km EW. Barrow No. 1, the first well on the BWI anticline, was drilled in 1964 with deep Jurassic targets at depths of up to 9,785 ft (McTavish 1965; Casey and Konecki 1967). A Drill Stem Test (DST) measured production rates of 985 BOPD from some of the upper Jurassic sections. Earlier in 2016, this well was recompleted and returned to service after many years of downtime, and still produces oil at commercial rates.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">This case study only concerns itself with the Windalia reservoir on BWI. In 2016, the Windalia reservoir accounted for the majority of oil production on BWI. The remainder is produced from pools in the Gearle, M3, Mardie B, Tunney, Malouet and Jurassic intervals (Fig. 2). The Windalia was originally drilled at an 80-acre production well spacing, however over time some areas have been infill drilled to as low as 40/20-acre well spacing with producers and injectors of varying patterns. A larger review of these details will be provided later.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The current petrophysical interpretation of the Windalia stratigraphy separates the rock into 9 distinct layers (Fig. 3). Broadly, the Windalia can be considered in two separate groups, the lower (8–9) and upper layers (1–6), separated by the middle shale (layer 7). The lower layers consist of lower quality mudstone and sandy mudstone facies. The middle shale is a laterally extensive layer of sub-mD rock that acts as a baffle between the upper and lower Windalia (Moo and Tweedy 1991).</p><div id="link-3">

Soon after 1970, the Q-block gas cap area was drilled with producers and injectors at 40 acre well spacing with the 5 spot water injection pattern.

<p id="Ancr8">Artificial lift was installed in production wells during the 1970s. During the early period, gas lift was predominant with some beam pump installations also on the island (Watson 1970). Today, gas lift has been completely decommissioned and production relies only on beam pumped wells (Fig. 6). Our experience has been that production rates and reliability with beam pumps are much higher than gas lift for this onshore, high water cut operation.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">From the mid-70s to mid-80s, over 125 infill wells were drilled in the Q, G and B block areas, most of which were producers. This is seen in the producer count in Fig. 7, along with production performance for the field. The well spacing was reduced in these blocks to 20 acres. Since water injection did not change substantially in the period, the oil decline continued over the decade.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">At high producing bottomhole pressures, some of the high oil-saturation, low reservoir pressure layers would be blocked out of production. It was essential for their operation that beam pumps were properly pumped off to minimise bottomhole pressure and allow flow of all strata (see Fig. 9). Jenkins and Eggert (2002) also describe the same strategy. Terrado et al. (2007) confirm the importance of pumping wells off, which they say reduces the chance of crossflow between different layers. These fields are very similar operationally to what we seek on BWI to maximise oil rate.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr16">At the current stage of increased water injection, most injectors are unchoked and not constrained by an upper target; however, a handful of wells are constrained in areas of the field where several injectors are online or beam pump units are smaller and cannot lift large rates. Care is taken (Fig. 13) to monitor the voidage replacement in each injector pattern and block, and as a result some injectors are choked for this purpose. Projects are underway to increase beam pump sizes in some of these areas.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr17">Monitoring these items allows the waterflood to be run in a seamless manner. Monthly meetings are also held between office and Field Operations to discuss broader field performance and project matters. An example waterflood performance chart is shown in Fig. 14. In addition to this, quarterly trips are made to the field where engineers inspect well leases and perform adjustments on individual injection rates for all wells.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr18">For reserves estimation, economic analysis and business planning, a Capicitance Resistant Model (CRM) is used to forecast oil production (Sayarpour 2009; Gan et al. 2012). There are some similarities between CRM and a decline curve approach; the relationship is shown in Fig. 15. CRM is more powerful for fast history matching and handling variable water injection rate schedules.</p><div id="link-17">
