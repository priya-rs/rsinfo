<p id="Ancr4">In a bottom water drive, the aquifer is present below the entire reservoir and water influx moves vertically upward into the oil zone. In an edge water drive, the aquifer is located on the flanks of the reservoir and the water moves upward along the reservoir dip, different aquifer geometry will give different energy and give different end result in terms the value of maximal recovery factor based on log data and depth structure analysis, for example the edge water aquifer in asri basin sand 34-X (Fig.1).</p><div id="link-1">

Each of compartment have different characteristic, and it help us to control and make better understanding about water injection condition and pattern in Windri area. Group 1 located in most western of Windri area, in consist of WF-03 producer and WF-04 injector wells and both of them can be pairing one injector and one producer. Group 2 structurally higher than group 1, it consist of WN-02, WF-01 producer and WF-02, WF-06 injector.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr19">Several lab analysis were conducted to identify fluid corrosive content. Water analysis had been performed to see the character fluids in each well. Based on lab Analysis all water samples have scale forming instead of Corrosive (Fig.16). Gas analysis also concluded that there is no indication of corrosive behavior. Therefore, the solution is to do quality control for tubing specification and also improve the makeup tubing connection procedure.</p><div id="link-16">
