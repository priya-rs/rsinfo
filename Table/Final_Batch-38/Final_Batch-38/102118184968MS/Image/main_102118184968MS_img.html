The flow rate is high enough to pick up the particles from the pipe bottom and keep them dispersed in the liquid.

<p id="Ancr14">Fig. 11 shows the critical velocity needed to keep particles in suspension through time. The critical velocity for any particle size will increase with the water cut; however, from with from 5% to 15% water cut, the critical velocity decreases. Besides that, SCV varies with the growth of the field. With field evolution, the water cut will increase; thus, higher critical velocity is required to transport all particles in suspension. After 103 months, water cut decreases (because it reaches 5%). This phenomenon occurs due to the emulsion effects on the fluid viscosity.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr16">Another sensibility study was performed to study the minimum flow rate required to transport different sizes of particles. The minimum flow rate required to transport the particle is reached when the superficial liquid velocity intersects the critical velocity. Above this intersection, sand is entrained. For example, the DCV found was to be 0.2 ft/s for grain size of 133 microns (P50) with water cut of 0%. This was compared against the superficial velocities. The intersection point becomes the cutoff point where sand is transportable. In addition, in Fig. 13, it is possible to verify that liquid flow rate below 12,000 STB/D will result in potential sand deposition in a pipe with inner diameter of 29.438 in. whereas, if the pipe has an inner diameter of 19.124 in., the minimum flow rate is 5,000 STB/D.</p><div id="link-13">

In addition, the maximum grain size that can be entrained at the pipe bottom happens when the superficial liquid velocity intersects the critical velocity; above this intersection, sand is entrained. If the water cut is 0%, the maximum size of transported grains is 235, 200, and 100 microns for the A2, A1, and A3 pipeline, respectively; a larger grain size than this diameter will potentially result in sand deposition.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr26">The sand settles down and starts to form a stationary sand bed, which creates high pressure losses (as shown in Fig. 23) and, consequently, reduces production. In addition, it can be seen that sand particles are transported in an intermittent way through the pipeline system, and therefore an intermittent pressurization occurs upstream. In this pipeline (T3-4), the sand bed is broken up by the liquid when the fluid velocity reaches the critical velocity, but as the cross-sectional area increases again and the local fluid velocity decreases, the energy is continuously consumed. The active sand particles become less energetic, and they settle at the bottom of the pipe and form a new sand deposit downstream, until they are picked up by another slug.</p><div id="link-23">

Therefore, a remediation operation is needed between days 279 and 313 to avoid a significant increase in the upstream pressure, It is possible to observe in Fig. 25 that the simulations predicted at day 313 a sand volume in the bed of 565 bbl or 210 tons along the entire gathering pipeline (from A2 pipeline connection to CPF). Pipeline pigging is a common method of sand removal, but the pigging program or the frequency is often determined by the pressure available to push sand ahead.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr31">Under that flow condition, sand deposition increases until the equilibrium condition is reached. Then particles drop out of the fluid to form a stationary bed height and, consequently, decrease the cross-sectional area, but momentarily with the local velocity increment. This phenomenon causes the movement of the particles that were deposited, and a moving bed begins to form at the top of the sand layer that initiates the return to the previous bed thickness, keeping the pressure constant, as shown in Fig. 28.</p><div id="link-28">

<p id="Ancr32">The last situation is more critical than the previous one because the sand cannot be transported as it was in the previous case during the simulated period. Therefore, pigging operations must be performed in the A2 pipeline. As can be seen in Fig. 29, the pressure reaches 200 psig at approximately 290 days. Thus to avoid this issue, it is necessary to perform a cleaning operation between day 150 and day 290. The sand deposit is 354 bbl (131 tons) along the pipe.</p><div id="link-29">
