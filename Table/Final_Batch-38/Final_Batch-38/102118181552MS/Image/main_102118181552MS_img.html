The sleeve length and stroke are very short. The metallurgy on sliding surfaces is specially treated to minimize surface deposition. Scrapers are installed to scrape deposition off of surfaces when shifted. A special seal technology (not o-rings) is used to achieve high pressure differential ratings in the closed position.

The next step was to perform similar hydraulic simulations using packers to compartmentalize the three zones and using passive ICDs to separately control the inflow from each zone.

Figure 27 shows wellhead liquid rate versus wellhead pressure for different nozzle settings (i.e., cross section area of nozzle throat). Note how the curves fall off steeper for WHPs below 3500 psi indicating that not much is gained by lowering WHP below this value.</p><div id="link-27">

Also shown (black curve) is the water-oil ratio which is minimized at 25.6 mm^2. Although minimizing water-oil ratio minimizes the cost of handling water production on surface, it is not necessarily the most economical setting since the oil rates are still rising sharply with increasing nozzle throat area.</p><div id="link-29">
