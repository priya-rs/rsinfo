<p id="Ancr1">The Lost Hills oil field is one of several significant oil fields located in the San Joaquin basin of central California [Graham and Williams, 1985]. The field is located about 45 miles northwest of Bakersfield in Kern County, Figure 1. The producing structure is a northwest-southeast trending double-plunging anticline [Brink, 2001]. The anticline is about 12 miles long and about 1 mile wide with high dipping flanks reaching up to approximatively ~20 degrees.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The three main sources of data consisted of reservoir characterization (wireline logs), well completion (perforations depth and footage), and well production performance (peak rate, first 3 months, etc.). A total number of 132 wells were drilling in the last two years and had available data for analysis. A map of the field is presented in Figure 2. The field was divided in three areas, as shown in Figure 2. Ten wells were randomly selected from each area for analysis.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">In addition to the reservoir characterization data, completion information such as the depth and total perforated footages was collected for each of the wells. The perforations data was merged with the log data and stored in the same repository table. A snapshot of the sample data containing the data for the study is shown in Figure 4. For every half foot, there is a binary indicator (column COMPL_OPEN) to represent whether perforations are present. The total perforation footage for each well is calculated using this track data.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The mean of each of the five clusters was returned from the FCM algorithm. The clusters were ranked by the DRES log, where the one with the least DRES log was labeled as the “bad” (shale) region and the one with the largest DRES was labeled as the “good” (sand) region. An example of the cluster means returned by the FCM algorithm is shown in Figure 5.</p><div id="link-5">
