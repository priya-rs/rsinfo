<p id="Ancr3">Combustion through flaring of the feed gas containing H2S leads to generation of Sulphur Dioxide (SO2). Quantitative dispersion modelling indicated that Sulphur Dioxide (SO2) generated during plant start-up flaring activities would result in very low ground level concentrations (1ppm – 2ppm) by the time the plume reached the Moreeb Hill area (Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">In order to alleviate concerns and establish a sound level of understanding between Company and the local population, a Flaring Awareness Program had been developed and rolled out. The program consisted of assembling a team of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) from various departments in the Company (e.g. Drilling, HSE, Public Relations (PR), etc.). Information on flaring awareness was collected, reviewed and developed into high quality pamphlets (Figure 4), which were translated and printed in three languages (English, Arabic and Hindi).</p><div id="link-4">
