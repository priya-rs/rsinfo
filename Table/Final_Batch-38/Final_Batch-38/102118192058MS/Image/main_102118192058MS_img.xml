<anchoringText id="Ancr1">Field B, located in the Balingian geological province approximately 80 km northwest of Bintulu, has a water depth of 90 ft and is highly compartmentalized and faulted with the presence of almost 100 faults. The field has three subfields further divided into nine fault compartments (Fig. 1). There are eight primary reservoirs with more than 20 sub-reservoirs stacked atop one another with multiple drive mechanisms, including water drive, gas-cap drive, and solution gas drive. Several of these sub-reservoirs are thick sands where communication exists between them through juxtapositions, sharing gas cap, or aquifer.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr2">Based on seismic data, the reservoir is bound by two large faults on the north and southeastern sides. In the middle of the reservoir is another smaller fault that separates the northern and southern sides of Reservoir X-7. These three faults draw closer to each other as they go northeast and toward the crest (Fig. 2). The geological setting enables the aquifer from the bottom and southwestern side to push the oil toward the crest, which is almost bound by the fault.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">Between 2005 and 2011, Reservoir X-7 produced an average of 100 BOPD with more than 90%watercut. There were multiple attempts from 2010 to 2011 to increase production from Reservoir X-7 by means of additional perforations; however, all attempts failed, and the additional perforations produced at an extremely high watercut (Fig. 4). By the end of 2011, the total cumulative oil production from the reservoir was 7.67 MMSTB with a RF of 40%.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">There was no indication of pressure drop in the reservoir even during its late life (2002 to 2017) when the producing GOR was exceptionally high, which normally reduces the pressure of water drive reservoirs (Fig. 5). This behavior supports the understanding that Reservoir X-7 is a strong water-drive reservoir. The reservoir drive mechanism and gas-cap production become conclusive when the contact/saturation log indicates that oil has migrated into the original gas cap and displaced the gas cap.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr6">The logging result showed possible oil over the target reservoir, indicating sweep was observed in the originally perforated interval (Fig. 6). The location where the oil column was identified by the contact/saturation log was originally a gas bearing sand. The interpretation that it was a gas bearing sand was supported by the butterfly effect from the density-neutron log that was starkly different compared to an oil bearing sand from the same reservoir. This finding indicated that oil had migrated into the original gas column in Reservoir X-7.</anchoringText>

The well delivered 500 BOPD oil gain with GOR of 5,000 scf/bbl, even though it was produced at a small bean size of 24/64 in. (Fig. 7). The watercut was reduced from 99% to 30% after the WSO and additional perforations operation. However, the oil rate was not sustained, and production gradually declined because of increasing watercut. After two years of production, the well delivered 0.19 MMSTB cumulative oil production before it was shut-in because of excessive watercut development.</anchoringText>

The proximity of OGOC and CPOWC explained why the two perforations of Reservoir X-7 below the OGOC in 2010 and 2011 were unsuccessful. Other findings from the material balance model were the presence of three other potential additional perforations opportunities Wells B-16, A-01, and B-12 which penetrated Reservoir X-7 at a similar depth to Well B-07 (Fig. 8).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">To maximize oil recovery and delay water breakthrough as long as possible, it was decided to perforate Well B-16 at the top of the sand in Reservoir X-7. The target depth was originally a gas bearing sand that was distinct from the butterfly effect of the neutron-density log (Fig. 9). Based on the quality of the sand, high porosity, and high permeability, the well is expected to produce a potential risked oil rate of 150 BOPD with incremental reserves of 0.11 MMSTB.</anchoringText>

The initial behavior of Well B-11 after the additional perforations indicated that the formation is still a gas bearing sand. Later behavior indicated that after a few months of production, the water contact moved up, and the well began to produce gas and water from Reservoir X-7.
