<p id="Ancr1">Field B, located in the Balingian geological province approximately 80 km northwest of Bintulu, has a water depth of 90 ft and is highly compartmentalized and faulted with the presence of almost 100 faults. The field has three subfields further divided into nine fault compartments (Fig. 1). There are eight primary reservoirs with more than 20 sub-reservoirs stacked atop one another with multiple drive mechanisms, including water drive, gas-cap drive, and solution gas drive. Several of these sub-reservoirs are thick sands where communication exists between them through juxtapositions, sharing gas cap, or aquifer.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Based on seismic data, the reservoir is bound by two large faults on the north and southeastern sides. In the middle of the reservoir is another smaller fault that separates the northern and southern sides of Reservoir X-7. These three faults draw closer to each other as they go northeast and toward the crest (Fig. 2). The geological setting enables the aquifer from the bottom and southwestern side to push the oil toward the crest, which is almost bound by the fault.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Both the gas/oil contact (GOC) and oil/water contact (OWC) of Reservoir X-7 can be observed from the wells’ Open Hole logs (Fig. 3), and the quality sand enables the Open Hole log to present a distinct signature of the GOC. Based on fluid contact, there is a 100 ft oil column in the reservoir sandwiched by a thick layer of aquifer and large gas cap with "m ratio" of approximately 1.2.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Between 2005 and 2011, Reservoir X-7 produced an average of 100 BOPD with more than 90%watercut. There were multiple attempts from 2010 to 2011 to increase production from Reservoir X-7 by means of additional perforations; however, all attempts failed, and the additional perforations produced at an extremely high watercut (Fig. 4). By the end of 2011, the total cumulative oil production from the reservoir was 7.67 MMSTB with a RF of 40%.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">There was no indication of pressure drop in the reservoir even during its late life (2002 to 2017) when the producing GOR was exceptionally high, which normally reduces the pressure of water drive reservoirs (Fig. 5). This behavior supports the understanding that Reservoir X-7 is a strong water-drive reservoir. The reservoir drive mechanism and gas-cap production become conclusive when the contact/saturation log indicates that oil has migrated into the original gas cap and displaced the gas cap.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">The logging result showed possible oil over the target reservoir, indicating sweep was observed in the originally perforated interval (Fig. 6). The location where the oil column was identified by the contact/saturation log was originally a gas bearing sand. The interpretation that it was a gas bearing sand was supported by the butterfly effect from the density-neutron log that was starkly different compared to an oil bearing sand from the same reservoir. This finding indicated that oil had migrated into the original gas column in Reservoir X-7.</p><div id="link-6">

(Fig. 7). The watercut was reduced from 99% to 30% after the WSO and additional perforations operation. However, the oil rate was not sustained, and production gradually declined because of increasing watercut. After two years of production, the well delivered 0.19 MMSTB cumulative oil production before it was shut-in because of excessive watercut development.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">The contact movement indicated that despite the OGOC being at 4,550 ft TVD, the current predicted OWC (CPOWC) has already reached 4,557 ft TVD while the current predicted GOC (CPGOC) had already moved to 4,515 ft TVD. The proximity of OGOC and CPOWC explained why the two perforations of Reservoir X-7 below the OGOC in 2010 and 2011 were unsuccessful. Other findings from the material balance model were the presence of three other potential additional perforations opportunities Wells B-16, A-01, and B-12 which penetrated Reservoir X-7 at a similar depth to Well B-07 (Fig. 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">To maximize oil recovery and delay water breakthrough as long as possible, it was decided to perforate Well B-16 at the top of the sand in Reservoir X-7. The target depth was originally a gas bearing sand that was distinct from the butterfly effect of the neutron-density log (Fig. 9). Based on the quality of the sand, high porosity, and high permeability, the well is expected to produce a potential risked oil rate of 150 BOPD with incremental reserves of 0.11 MMSTB.</p><div id="link-9">

However, the producing well GOR ranged from 5,000 to 9,000 scf/bbl, which was slightly higher compared to the perforation in Well B-07. The additional perforations managed to produce for three years before watering out with a cumulative oil production of 0.22 MMSTB, twice the amount of the estimated incremental reserves.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">The OGOC for Reservoir X-7 was observed in Well A-01. Similar to Well B-16, it was decided to perforate Well A-01 at the top of the sand in Reservoir X-7 to maximize oil recovery. Additionally, the target depth was originally a gas-bearing sand with an evident distinction compared to the oil bearing sand below it (Fig. 11). In terms of sand quality, Reservoir X-7 in Well A-01 has an average porosity and permeability of 21% and 400 md, respectively. The well is expected to produce a risked oil rate of 200 BOPD with incremental reserves of 0.12 MMSTB.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">To control the watercut, the well was produced at a small bean-size of 16/64 in. Despite this, the well successfully produced 350 BOPD incremental oil with GOR less than 2,500 scf/bbl (Fig. 12). However, the WSO was a complete success, with watercut reduced from 100% to 0% and maintained at 0% for almost a year. Once water breakthrough occurred, well production gradually declined until it reached 99% watercut. After two years of production, Well A-01 delivered cumulative oil production of 0.14 MMSTB.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">The latest Reservoir X-7 material balance model revealed that the OWC was already at the additional perforations depth in late 2006, which explained the high watercut production. In a similar way to the other two wells, B-16 and A-01, it was decided to perform WSO on the 2006 additional perforations and perform new perforations in the original gas bearing sand of Reservoir X-7 (Fig. 13). Based on the good sand quality and thick oil column, the well is expected to deliver 400 BOPD oil gain with estimated reserves of 0.46 MMSTB.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr14">In a similar way to Wells B-16 and A-01, the well was produced with a small bean-size of 24/64 in. to control the watercut. Well B-12 delivered the highest production rate of the three wells with approximately 1,000 BOPD incremental oil production. Additionally, the watercut was successfully reduced from 100%to 0% (Fig. 14). Despite the small bean-size, water breakthrough occurred after six months of production, which gradually declined. After three years of production, the well has delivered 0.21 MMSTB cumulative oil production and, as of 01 January 2018, is still producing at 320 BOPD.</p><div id="link-14">

The unperforated sand lobe is approximately 25 ft TVD higher compared to current watered-out perforations (Fig. 15). It was decided to perform a similar operation for Well B-07 as before by isolating the current perforation and adding perforations in the higher sand lobe.

<p id="Ancr16">Despite the setbacks in WSO, water production was successfully reduced from 900 to 200 BWPD (Fig. 16). However, there was no increase in oil production, and the watercut remained at 98%. Meanwhile, gas production increased significantly to approximately 5.0 MMscf/D, indicating that the formation is still a gas bearing sand. Going forward, it was decided to continue producing the well until an increase in either oil or water production is observed. Nevertheless, the well was shut in indefinitely because of surface facility issues and field gas venting exceeding the venting limit.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr17">By the time it was proposed to add perforations in Reservoir X-7 in Well B-11, the previously added perforations in Wells A-01 and B-16, (which were in the vicinity of Well B-11) were producing 60% and 80% watercut, respectively. The bottom sand of Reservoir X-7 in Well B-11 is at 4,523 ft TVD, which is 4 ft deeper than the top sand of Reservoir X-7 in Well A-01 at 4,519 ft TVD (Fig. 3). The depth of Reservoir X-7 sand in Well B-11 and the fact that Well A-01 is producing at 60% watercut makes it obvious that Well B-11 is another additional perforations opportunity. Similar to the previous wells, the target depth is originally a gas bearing sand in Reservoir X-7 (Fig. 17).</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr18">The additional perforations in Well B-11 was unsuccessful. The well initially produced a higher amount of gas at 4.0 MMscf/D and gross rate of 200 BLPD. After four months of production, the gas rate declined to 3.0 MMscf/D, but the gross rate increased to 800 BLPD (Fig. 18). However, the watercut was sustained at more than 90% the entire time. The initial behavior of Well B-11 after the additional perforations indicated that the formation is still a gas bearing sand. Later behavior indicated that after a few months of production, the water contact moved up, and the well began to produce gas and water from Reservoir X-7. Well B-11 behavior also indicated that there are no more oil columns in Reservoir X-7 in the vicinity of Wells B-11, A-01, and B-16.</p><div id="link-18">
