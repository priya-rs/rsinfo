<p id="Ancr5">In addition, the intralayer and areal heterogeneity is also strong. So the overall water floodingis seriously uneven. And the distribution of residual oil is dispersive and the economy of oilfield development is becoming worse. Therefore, it is necessary to develop applicable EOR methods. As shown in Fig.1, the NPF technique was applied to the 12 well groups in the eastern part of the oilfield from May, 2014 to Feb., 2016. The new polymer particles were used as the main slug and a crosslinked polymer gel slug was pre-set placed.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">To identify the macroscopic planar development of water-flowing channels of the reservoir, trace tests had been carried out on 3 injection well patterns, and the results showed a big direction and velocity difference of water flooding within the same well pattern. As shown in Fig. 2, the lowest water flooding velocity was 1.35 m/d and the highest was 7.04 m/d.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">From the injectivity profile, as Fig. 3 left, and the production profile, as Fig.3 right, it can be seen that the main water intaking and liquid producing zones are Ed3 II and Ed3 III. The water intaking and liquid producing abilities have large difference among the subdivided layers. With the proceeding of water injection, the interlayer contradiction get worsened.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">As Fig.4 showing, the LPG slug was injected from May, 2014 to Jan, 2015, which was greatly exceed the planed injection period, 145 days. The main reason was that the bad gelling quality of LPG due to preparing by produced water was found through sufficient testing and varifying, and the preaparing water had to be changed into fresh water in Jul, 2014. The gelling quality was improved, but it led to quickinjection pressure rising and high rising amplitude.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr12">As shown in Fig.8, before the implementation of NPF project in the oilfield, from 2012 to 2015, the production has been decreased rapidly. However, after the implementation of NPF project in 2015, the annual decline rate has been slowed down from 10.4% in 2015 to 0.2% in 2016. Based on the current trend up to August 2017, it is predicted to be reversed to -5.0% in 2017 and the overall development of the oilfield will be improved.</p><div id="link-8">
