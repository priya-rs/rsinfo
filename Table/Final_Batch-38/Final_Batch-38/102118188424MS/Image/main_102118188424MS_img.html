Figure 2 shows the resultant foam apparent viscosity vs. gas saturation in a theoretical condition where only gas and water are present. Apparent viscosity is defined in Equation 2, where K is the effective permeability, S is cross-section area, ΔP is the pressure drop, L is the horizontal length and Q, the fluid rate.</p><div id="link-2">

Figure 9 is a tornado plot that shows the percentage of change in incremental oil recovery when varying one parameter at a time. Most of the factors can strongly affect the performance of the foam application; the way to reduce uncertainty is through experimental work and pilot implementation.</p><div id="link-9">

For wells A and B the latest measured values are about a third of the initial formation water salinity. Well C, an older well that has been affected by water injection since 2003, shows lower water salinity, in line with the injection water. It is also worth mentioning that there is a recently increasing trend in injection water salinity due to higher water recycling as the watercut of the field increases.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr28">A foam generator was placed upstream of the core to assure that the foam had already formed when it entered the core. Foam was injected into the core at fixed rate (3 m/d) and increasing quality (0 –100 %) while measuring the pressure drop between inlet and outlet (Figure 22). Apparent viscosity was subsequently calculated as per Equation 2. Figure 23 plots the results of the experiment; i.e. apparent viscosity as a function of gas mass fraction in the injected foam and the resulting fitting curve used to derive simulation foam parameters (Boeije &amp; Rossen, 2015) for the base simulation prediction previously shown.</p><div id="link-22">
