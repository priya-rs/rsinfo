<p id="Ancr3">The first step of the Improve Oil Recovery (IOR) process is to capture the upside potential by careful interpretation and analysis of historical data while gaining an understanding of the current surface and sub-surface constraints. As the production life cycle reaches the decline phase it coincides with an aging infrastructure that typically requires additional maintenance capital to maintain operations. As illustrated in Figure 1, this creates a challenging environment for any production optimization initiative as available positive cash flow becomes increasingly lower and lower with time.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">For any maturing WF oil field, a major challenge is maintaining a positive netback (profit) while the asset’s total production is in decline. As oil production declines, the operating cost will inversely increase on a per unit, or per barrel of oil produced, basis. The result is an ever-decreasing netback that will inevitably reach $0, the shut-in point highlighted in Figure 2. To counter this, optimizing the current infrastructure and incorporating proper reservoir management will help lower the overall production decline rate while also reducing the total operating costs of the field.</p><div id="link-2">

The Sparky C is a regional sand, coarsening up, which grades from shale to very fine grained sand (reference Figure 5). It is sourced from the west and distributed south west to north east, creating a permeability trend in said direction (Baker and Gregor 1989).</p><div id="link-5">

Even though the total injection stream had been kept close to constant from 2006 until 2013, the steep oil production decline could not be mitigated. This is largely due to un-optimized individual injection rates that resulted in an inefficient pattern sweep with severe conformance issues.

<p id="Ancr15">Given the dynamic nature of displacement recovery mechanism, production optimization is defined as managing production of hydrocarbons as things change over time. Therefore an interactive framework was developed to advance the implementation of a dynamic WF optimization process for three Western Canadian medium oil fields, described in the previous section. The main objective is to optimize production and injection rates of already developed pools with the parallel goal of reducing Opex and increasing capital efficiency.

<p id="Ancr24">To integrate well location with historical trends and diagnostic tools, Chan and Hall plots were plotted for all the patterns in their respective location on a field wide map. Then any evidence was recorded along with dye and tracer test result. The information then used for flow characterization, conformance issue evaluation and ultimately tuning injection targets. Figure 22 illustrate one example of this type of evaluation for only one pattern and show the location of C/03-30 pattern in Wildmere pool selected as an example for conformance issue treatment.</p><div id="link-22">

As an example, Figure 25 shows the location of an injector that was tested with the offset producers which were sample. High concentrations of the tracer were detected at three producers as interpreted in Figure 26 to Figure 28 (D/08-32, D/02-32 and B/07-32). This confirms that there is fluid movement between these wells and the injector (INJ D/8-32). The flow of tracer indicates the presence of highly permeable thief channels from the injector towards the producers.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr31">2014 - 2015, operating expense (Opex) for this region was predominantly ~$30.00. Figure 29 shows a historical plot of percentage change of $/boe compared to the 2001 base line. The Opex has been increasing till 2013 and since then with the positive impact of WF reservoir management it has been dropping. Further analysis of the variable portion of the Opex showed that 45% of this cost was related to well optimization projects.</p><div id="link-29">
