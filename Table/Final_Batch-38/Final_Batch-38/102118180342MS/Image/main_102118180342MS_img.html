<p id="Ancr2">The DW GOM has been an area of interest for oil and gas exploration. The operator was active in drilling exploratory and development wells in DW GOM in water depths exceeding 4,000 ft. for the majority of this time. The subject wells presented in this case study are in the Walker Ridge, Keathley Canyon and Garden Banks areas of the central DW GOM (Fig.1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The target reservoir in the area of interest is overlain with a thick sequence of salt and sub-salt formation. The salt formations present in these areas are predominantly halite, while the sub-salt lithology comprises marl, shale, claystone, siltstone and sandstone with limestone stringers. Salt formation thickness varies between 9,000 and 20,000 ft. Fig.2 is a generic lithological column in the area of interest.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The PDC bits most commonly used to drill these sections have eight blades and 16 mm cutters with bodies mostly comprised of steel. The aggressiveness levels have been optimized for performance in accordance with the lithology and BHA requirements. An alternative hybrid bit technology emerged which combines the crushing action of rolling cones and the shearing action of PDC cutters. The initial hybrid bit used comprises 19 mm cutters, three cones and three blades (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Fig. 5 shows the depth-based PDC bit torque in salt, along with the first hybrid run. All bit runs had a concentric reamer in the BHA, except Run-1. Because of the shearing action of the PDCs, the torque fluctuations are high, even when the reamer was closed. Tab. 1 indicates a high standard deviation or torque fluctuation for PDC bits. High torque fluctuations have the potential for initiating torsional oscillations which can cause the loss of drilling efficiency. While drilling interbedded sub-salt formations with a PDC bit, high stick-slip, lateral, and torsional vibrations were regularly observed.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The operator selected a hybrid bit to address the challenges presented by drilling salt and sub-salt formation. The hybrid bit combines the crushing and gouging action of a roller-cone with the shearing action of PDC cutting elements (Fig. 3). The central portion of the hole is cut by the shearing action of the PDC while the relatively difficult outer portion of the hole is cut by both cutting elements10(Fig. 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">All runs were vertical and had similar depths, and therefore, the drill string torque and drag is assumed constant for all runs. The first hybrid bit completed the 3,581 ft. interval at an average ROP of 102 ft/hr, while instantaneous ROPs reached as high as 128 ft/hr (Fig. 7). A conservative approach was taken on the first run, so the average ROP was slightly lower than the best PDC offset. As parameters were optimized, each subsequent hybrid run improved the record performances. Average on-bottom ROP increased to 124.5 ft/hr, 156.6 ft/hr and 193.4 ft/hr. Compared to the best PDC offset performance, this was an improvement of 20%, 50% and 86% respectively.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">Each well used a variety of parameters to optimize performance, so mechanical specific energy (MSE) is used to compare efficiencies13 across the two bit types using surface parameters. The efficiencies of each bit and the total mechanical horsepower distributed to the bits were compared (Fig. 8) against one another.</p><div id="link-8">

PDC bit runs are represented by red points while the hybrids bits are represented by blue points. Bits runs which were exclusively in salt were excluded from the graph. Bits that drilled both salt and subsalt are represented by only the sub-salt footage and average ROP for the sub-salt interval that they drilled.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Most hybrid runs displayed lower vibration levels in salt and sub-salt formation; however, for the like-to-like comparison, a PDC and a hybrid run in sub-salt formations is compared whereby the PDC run was in the original hole and the hybrid bit was used for drilling a sidetrack (Fig. 10). The PDC bit run, showed in red, displayed high and unsustainable levels of torsional oscillations and lateral vibration while drilling Pliocene sandstone and the ROP dropped below 50ft/hr and the PDC bit was tripped out of the hole.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">The PDC bit run, showed in red, displayed high and unsustainable levels of torsional oscillations and lateral vibration while drilling Pliocene sandstone and the ROP dropped below 50ft/hr and the PDC bit was tripped out of the hole. It was later discovered that BHA parts were left downhole and it was decided to sidetrack the well with a motor assembly and a hybrid bit. Dull pictures of the PDC indicated significant abrasive wear with some impact damage from vibration (Fig. 11). The abrasive wear was caused while drilling sandstone.</p><div id="link-11">
