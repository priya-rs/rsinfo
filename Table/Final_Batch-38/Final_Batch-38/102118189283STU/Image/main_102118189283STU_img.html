<p id="Ancr1">The team planned to implement a pilot waterflood program consisting of nine producers and four injectors arranged in an inverted 5-spot, 40-acre pattern (Figure 1). Seven of the nine producers were already producing from the Clearfork. As for the other two, one would be recompleted from the Fusselman formation, and the other would be re-drilled. The four injectors would be new drills. The main reason for not converting existing wells to injectors was because many of the existing producers had perforations in the Tubb, Clearfork, and Glorieta. This caused concern regarding efficiency.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">First, a static model of the Winkler County area was created by the team geologist. It modeled every horizon between the Glorieta and Tubb formations. Figure 2 displays the structure of the Clearfork, which lies between the aforementioned horizons. Outlined in black is the Winkler County Lease which encompasses a North-South oriented anticline composed of dolomitized carbonates that were deposited in a shallow water environment. The porosity and permeability are approximately 5% and 5 md, respectively.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The greatest challenge in history matching was the vast amount of uncertainty that surrounded almost every aspect of the model. This uncertainty was grouped into two categories: geologic, as in pertaining to the static model, and reservoir, or pertaining to the dynamic model. A selection of the key uncertainties and assumptions made can be found in Figure 3. The root of uncertainty was lack of data.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">One of the history matching parameters was relative permeability. Figure 4 shows cumulative oil production as a function of time for several different cases of relative permeability. It demonstrates that one small tweak can have a significant impact on the final result.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">This caused the wells to not be able to produce the total liquid rate; the wells simply were not connected to enough of the reservoir to match historical production. Some team members visited the core warehouse with a geologist to look at core from a well within the lease (Figure 5). It was obvious to everyone that there was significantly less than 30 percent anhydrite; in addition, the anhydrite did not form laminations that would prevent vertical movement of reservoir fluids.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">With these changes to the static model, the history matching process improved drastically. A final history match was obtained shortly thereafter and is shown in Figure 6. This verified the model under the assumption that once the model behaves in a way consistent with history, it will behave like the actual wells in the future. With an acceptable history match, the last step of the simulation workflow involved estimating the reservoir response to the pilot waterflood.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">A dimensionless plot of hydrocarbon pore volume and secondary incremental recovery (Figure 7) was used to generate a production forecast based on the analog. Using the refined OOIP and expected water injection, one can predict reservoir response based on the analog field’s response to the same proportion of injection. As in the simulation model, a total water injection rate of 2,000 BWPD was assumed (500 BWPD/well).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">This value was established based on the guaranteed water supply. The pressure of each producing well was examined at the end of the historical case, and a unique bottomhole pressure constraint was established that aimed to smooth the transition between the historical and predictive cases. With the constraints established, the Clearfork’s response to water injection was estimated. The results are displayed in Figure 8. Future work may involve varying the water injection rate and improving conformance within the model.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">When these cases were run together in an economics software, the project was found to have a $51 breakeven oil price at a 10% discount rate. Like most oil and gas projects, the economic viability is highly sensitive to oil price (Figure 9). At $60 oil, the project has a present value of $1.3 MM.</p><div id="link-9">
