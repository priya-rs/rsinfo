<p id="Ancr4">Grechka, Li, Howell, Garcia, and Wooltorton (2017) showed for the case of the Middle Bakken dolomites that microseismic events may play a role of high frequency sources for HF evaluation. For the sake of computational time 5ftvoxel was chosen. From the same observation we can conclude that all 4 clusters of Stage 19 were open. Based on seismic attributes presented in the paper (Dip and Azimuth), we present an interpretation that detectable half lengths (Xf) were approximately 65-75 ft with a reasonable height of 240-260 ft (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Dynamic to static correlation in our study for offset well (#31) has a similar polynomial relationship (solid blue curve in Fig. 3), buta formula proposed by Lacy (1997) underestimates static modulus for ~25%(black dashed curve). A correlation for static PR is more problematic probably because micro cracks are selective slowing compressional waves even for preserved, “as received” rock samples. One should also note that ultrasonic tests on core samples are based on high-frequency sources (1 MHz) in comparison to (~10kHz) used in logging tools which can add additional error into sonic log analysis.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">From comparison of Figures 3 and 4 we can conclude that PRDTC has a reasonable match with PR calculated from ISIP. The second observation is that PR varies ±10% for individual stages indicating minor stress shadowing. We provide one of the possible explanations for such minor stress shadowing shown below.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Such numerical artifacts may lead to inefficient well spacing and stacking decisions. In addition, we found that proppant transportation and height confinement of individual clusters are also grid size dependent. To illustrate that we compared in (Fig. 5) test runs for the same synthetic data similar to that for the well #46. We modeled one stage with 3 clusters 50 ft apart, thus the only difference between the two cases was the node size 7.5ft ×15ft and 2.5ft ×5.0ft respectively.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">The proppant tends to settle faster, forming dunes and thin layers of higher proppant concentration, which may cause pitchouts as shown in Figure 6 for the test run of well #46 Stage 2 with five clusters. More importantly, with a coarse grid, the HF may be calculated artificially wider and smoother. In this case, an engineer will have an overly optimistic proppant placement scenario. The leak off is highly pressure-dependent especially in the proximity of the wellbore.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr11">It is observed from Fig. 8 that many MS events from Stage 5 are generated around Stage 4, so we can conclude that liquid from the Stage 5 reinitiated a lot of MS in the area already stimulated by the Stage 4. The liquid is constantly trying to find the path of least resistance, so interpretation of MS events may help in identification of inefficient pad fluid leakoff. Possible losses of pad fluid preferably into the area stimulated by previous stages may also be a result of fluid migration through of highly conductive axial fracture (orange line in Fig. 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">The pressure dependent leakoff was calculated for the range of treating pressures from 7,000 psi to 11,000 psi and for various h/a0. The calculation results for the case of h/a0=0.4are presented at semi-log plot in Fig. 9, together with the best fit exponential curve. From the fitting equation, the pressure dependent leakoff coefficient (PDL) is 0.00047 psi−1, which is close to one we used before MS data was available for analysis – 0.0005 psi−1.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">Despite reasonable results of geomechanical modeling indicating 100% cluster efficiency for all tested stages, we ran test cases with variations of cluster designs. To show the importance of stress shadowing and engineering design, we left all pumping parameters the same except we artificially closed clusters #1 and #3 for Stages 3-14. This change resulted in more liquid and proppant available for each of three open clusters, more vertically symmetrical reservoir stimulation, better proppant placement laterally, and more conductive axial fractures (Fig. 13).</p><div id="link-13">
