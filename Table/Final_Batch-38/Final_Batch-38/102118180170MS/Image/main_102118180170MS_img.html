<p id="Ancr6">The steam is injected for a period of time, normally several months; once this phase finishes, the injectors and producers switch their functions and they operate for a period equal to the first stage, completing in this way the cycle. Figure 1 represents two different moments of the HASD operation; left graph shows the temperature in the field at the end of the fourth injection period (year 8 of HASD operation) for wells 1, 3, 5, whereas the right graph shows the end of the fifth injection period (year 10 of HASD operation) for wells 0, 2, 4.</p><div id="link-1">

Wells are preferentially oriented West-East or East-West increasing the opportunity to cross the higher amount of sand channels. To ensure the symmetry, the configuration used in the simulation model, that covers one of the cluster branches, is the one shown in the Figure 7; it can be seen that the sector includes 6 wells, with simulation of half wells located at the North and South boundaries, for a total of 5 effective horizontal wells per sector.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr13">As an example, in the Figures 8 to 11 the results of the optimization for the Medium Quality sector can be observed. Figure 8 shows the Sobol analysis of the parameters, analyzing their impact on NPV. The Sobol method is a powerful method to quantify the relative importance of input factors as well as their interactions. The first-order index (indicated by the green bar in the graph) represents the main effect contribution of each input factor to the variance of the output; second value, indicated by the red bar in the graph, measures how much each parameter interacts with other input factors. The Sobol analysis shows that the steam rate injected during the HASD stage is the most important parameter to be taken into account in this reservoir quality, whereas the duration of each HASD cycle has a very limited influence on the output.</p><div id="link-8">
