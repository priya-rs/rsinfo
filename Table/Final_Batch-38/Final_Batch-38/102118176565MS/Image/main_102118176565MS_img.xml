<anchoringText id="Ancr4">This experiment also proved low efficiency of surface water injection. Actually from the first days of an experiment dramatical downhole and wellhead pressure raise was observed, along with injection rate decrease (fig. 2). Further investigations showed that effective permeability near the well dropped to non-reservoir values, practically causing injection to stop. It makes it impossible to increase replacement ratio. Wellhead pressure increase was not used to prevent development of auto-fractures.</anchoringText>
