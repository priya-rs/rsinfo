<p id="Ancr3">The absence of traditional signs of PMS work is caused mainly by low current and accumulated replacement ratio on the early stages of injection (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">This experiment also proved low efficiency of surface water injection. Actually from the first days of an experiment dramatical downhole and wellhead pressure raise was observed, along with injection rate decrease (fig. 2). Further investigations showed that effective permeability near the well dropped to non-reservoir values, practically causing injection to stop. It makes it impossible to increase replacement ratio. Wellhead pressure increase was not used to prevent development of auto-fractures.</p><div id="link-2">

An example of log-log analysis of one of such wells if shown on fig.9, representing typical pressure derivative behavior in case of closed boundary model, i.e. depletion mode. In different cases, it was caused by long distance to injector or geologic boundaries effects, which if quite logical and excludes false influence conclusions on previous well groups.</p><div id="link-9">
