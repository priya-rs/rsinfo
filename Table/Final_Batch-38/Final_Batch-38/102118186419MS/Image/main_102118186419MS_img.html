<p id="Ancr4">Hence, a more comprehensive workflow is needed for the development of unconventional plays. The objective of this work is to propose a more comprehensive workflow to evaluate the stimulation effectiveness and forecast the well performance on the SRV scale. The workflow is an integration of microseismic data, welltesting interpretation, rate normalized pressure (RNP) interpretation, and numerical production history match, as illustrated in Fig. 1. The welltesting interpretation and RNP interpretation are conducted on a semianalytical model with boundary element method (BEM).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Recently, the technique of microseismic monitoring (MSM) has been the significant tool to capture the hydraulic fracture growth. This technique is also an important component of our workflow. Fig. 2 provides the basic principles of MSM (Cipolla et al., 2011). The monitored microseismic events are recorded by the seismic sensors in the downhole of monitoring well. The locations of microseismic events are determined by P- and S-wave sonic velocity model. Using the polarization of P- and/or S-wave signals, one can identify the fracture azimuth. The fracture depth can be diagnosed by analyzing the seismic sensors simultaneously.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Model development. Physical Model. In this paper, we develop a composite physical model for fractured horizontal wells with SRV using VFM. Considering that it is hard for fluid flow to arrive the outbound reservoir system, we don’t take the outbound reservoir into consideration, and we develop a three-region physical model to describe the SRV, as shown in Fig. 3. In our physical model, Region I is composed of hydraulic fractures and fracture networks. The fracture networks are approximately modeled by Warren and Root’s dual-porosity media.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">Model Solution. Both hydraulic fractures and boundary sections are discretized to obtain the transient pressure solution of MFHW in the composite reservoir. We assume that the nf hydraulic fractures are divided into ns segments. Pressure in each fracture segment is assumed to be uniform once the fracture segment is tiny. Hence, we mainly consider the pressure at the center of each fracture segment. The boundary sections, Γ1, Γ2, Γ3, are separately divided into N1, N2, N3 linear segments, as shown in Fig. 4.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">With the RNP and RNP’, the well performance with variable bottomhole pressure and production rate can be transformed into an equivalent case with a constant production rate. Fig. 5 was plotted by Song and Economide (2011) to show the transient pressure behavior of MFHW using RNP and RNP’s. One can see that the RNP performance is similar to pressure transient behavior with a constant production rate. That’s to say, based on RNP and RNP’, our proposed well-testing model is applicable to estimate the SRV properties using the production data.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr13">Well Testing Interpretation. After stimulation, a buildup testing of Well CJ was performed. The duration of the well testing lasted about 168 hours. The testing data including pressure and pressure derivative are provided in Fig. 10. It is found that due to the short testing time, the pressure buildup only occurred in Regions I and II, and the fluid in Region III is not affected by the buildup test. Hence, we divide the transient pressure characters (pressure and pressure derivative) of Well CJ into two parts, Region I and Region II (Fig. 10).</p><div id="link-10">

Based on the numerical model, we perform a 5-year of oil production prediction using the history match results, and the predicted oil volume and rate are showed in Fig. 14. As can be seen, after 5-year of production the total oil volume is about 2.25×104 m3, and the oil rate sharply decreases to 2 m3/d. This is because the oil drainage is dominated by the SRV-affected region (Region I and II). Once the oil flow reaches the unstimulated area (Region III), the production rate declines rapidly due to ultra-low permeability, as to be physically expected.</p><div id="link-14">
