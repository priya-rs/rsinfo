<p id="Ancr2">The field is located in the North of Oman. It is a shallow 20Km long elongated carbonate monocline with an eroded fault escarpment and a hydrocarbon column of more than 400 m. This carbonate reservoir consists of seven sub-units of cretaceous age which are separated by extensive shale layers (see Fig.1), yet in dynamic interaction via faults and fractures.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The field is a long monocline located in the tilted footwall of a partly-inverted NW-SE regional-scale normal fault. The general structure of the field has evolved during two major stages of deformation: Late Cretaceous (Alpine I) and Miocene (Alpine II). Structural features at all scales systematically belong to two main directional sets oriented respectively along WNW and NW strike directions. These two main sets of fracture orientation reflect the imprint at reservoir scale of the well-calibrated regional structural history2,3 (see fig.3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">This is a very shallow giant oil field. The hydrocarbons storage resides within the porous matrix (see fig.6) despite the overwhelming imprint of fractures on fluid transport and performance described in the previous chapter. Facies and reservoir quality are fairly variable throughout the stratigraphy; microporous bioturbated carbonate facies (high porosity and low permeability) are dominant, in particular in our units of interest.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The main control on porosity and permeability is now understood to be the water depth at the time of deposition influencing the initial fabrics and their diagenetic overprint: deposition at deeper water depth (at the bottom of the sequences) results on muddier facies that through dissolution transform into higher porosity despite lower permeability (see Fig. 8-right). The minor contrast but consistent stacking of rock quality has consequences for development, since we have observed1 a preferential de-saturation of marginally less porous intervals at the top of the sequences (apparently defying gravity but consistent with core data and log resistivity post injection).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr21">When two floor development wells are active at the same time, the simulation results show indeed that theoretical incremental recovery from the matrix block with these two wells is minor when compared to a single well development (see Fig.20). In practical terms, the strategy to pair wells to ensure drainage of potential subseismic blocks and to shelter deeper wells from gas should be further investigated. It is recommended to place the GOGD floor development well as downdip as possible in the structure to benefit from the structure dip and maximize oil recovery from the matrix block. In pragmatic terms that might be difficult to achieve for the smaller grid blocks.</p><div id="link-20">
