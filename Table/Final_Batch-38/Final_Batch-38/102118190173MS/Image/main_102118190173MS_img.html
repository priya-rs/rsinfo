<p id="Ancr5">Cyclic steam stimulation (CSS), commonly referred to as “Huff-n-Puff”, involves steam injection into a reservoir during some weeks (injection stage). Allowing the reservoir to undergo a short period of “soaking” where the well is closing during a few days; and then flowing back and/or pumping stage during some months according to: steam volume injected, reservoir properties, well operational conditions, well performance, among others. When the oil rate declines and reaches a similar point to the oil rate before the injection, then it is time to initiate a new steam cycle. Figure 3 present the process.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">A typical life span of CSS has eight or twelve cycles (Liu, 2012). The process efficiency and oil incremental is reducing during successive steam cycles while water cut is increasing; consequently, it is necessary to inject higher steam volume (Figure 5). According to Gallant (1993), with each successive cycle, longer periods are required for oil (or bitumen) production rates to ramp up to peak levels. This situation affects negatively the steam oil ratio and the economy of the process.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Given that the answer to the cyclic steam injection has declined significantly in some wells due to number of cycles, a pilot project to assess the feasibility of injecting nitrogen accompanied cyclic steam was raised. It used a numerical simulation model of an interest sector to determinate optimum volumes and injection scheme. The sector model used in this research showed in Figure 6 has an area of 17 acres, with 3.4 MMBls of original oil in place. The initial oil saturation is 64% and the initial reservoir pressure is 950 Psi (01-01-2008).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">It evaluated eleven schemes of steam + nitrogen injection using numerical simulation. In all schemes, it was tested remained constant volume of injected steam (except 2, corresponding to nitrogen injection only), while the volume of nitrogen varied according to the scheme (pre-injection, post-injection, co-injection or a combination of the above). Table 1 presents all the cases evaluated, red cases were discarding because according to the simulation results in Figure 7, their production is lower than the the base case (only steam). In all cases, it assumed nitrogen injection rate according to real drive capacity 1200 m3/hour (1017072 ft3/day).</p><div id="link-7">

This case corresponds to start injecting only one day with nitrogen, followed by five days of co-injection and ending with a single nitrogen day.
