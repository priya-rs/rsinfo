<p id="Ancr3">The work of Earlougher (1977) discusses the classical interference analysis approach using the notion of "time lag" in order to determine mean reservoir properties. For an interference pulse test, the time lag is the time taken for the observing well to respond to change in active well behaviour, particularly for the period from when the active well ceases to flow until response in behaviour is observed at the observation well. The concept of time lag is shown as Figure 3, with the phenomena of time lag being the time for an observing well to change from an established trend when active well ceases to produce.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Well flowbacks were simulated from multiple reservoir dynamic models. Each dynamic model had the same flowback profile applied to flowing the active well, being an initial rate of 30 MMScf/d scaling up to 80 MMScf/d at 2% rate every 30 minutes, with a total flow period of 18 hours. The active well was then shut in and pressure pulse propagation to the observation well simulated in the model for a period of 30 days. The gas production profile representing the well unloading for the active well in the simulation model is shown as Figure 4. All other wells in the model are shut-in with down-hole pressure monitored.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr13">The approach for the transient map based numerical modelling method was to extract a representative map from the reservoir interval that both active and observer wells intersected in the Wheatstone reference dynamic model and transfer this map into the transient numerical model. The resulting map shows representative boundaries of net reservoir and variations in the net reservoir thickness. An active well and observer well were then placed per their respective locations in the transient numerical model. The scale for the transient model was set correctly to the distance between the two wells at ~1.6 km. This map based numerical modelling process is shown in Figure 13.</p><div id="link-13">
