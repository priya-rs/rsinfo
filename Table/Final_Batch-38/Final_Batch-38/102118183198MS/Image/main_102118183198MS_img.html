<p id="Ancr1">To support the development of the UAE’s oil and gas reserves, enhance production capacity toward a goal of 3.5 million barrels per day, and reduce gas imports for the country as a whole, ADMA-OPCO recently engaged in significant exploration and appraisal activity. Several oil and gas assets, identified decades ago but not yet developed, underwent detailed evaluation (Fig. 1). These targets include marginal fields and deeper, tighter reservoirs, which present many significant challenges.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Although a large number of formations in the offshore UAE are hydrocarbon-bearing (Fig. 2), their development faces three major challenges: reservoirs exhibit significant vertical and lateral heterogeneity in petrophysical properties and reservoire fluids, which makes properties estimation from nearby analogs challenging; hydrocarbon fluids are associated with significant amounts of corrosive gases (H2S and CO2), which impacts both test design and choice of applicable procedures; and numerous fields and formations are being evaluated concurrently, which places great demands on engineering management of operations planning, execution, and interpretation.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The selected wireless telemetry system uses the DST string as a medium for acoustic signal transmission between downhole modems connected to gauges or test tools and a surface node wired to a data acquisition system. The signal can be transmitted across a distance of up to 2,000 ft, but repeaters are typically placed every 1,000 ft to ensure redundancy and continuity of data transmission. Key downhole communication nodes are part of the deployed tools, whereas repeaters are clamped to the DST string during run-in-hole operations. A typical string is shown on Fig. 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">A more important validation could only be performed at the end of the test (when memory gauges had been retrieved at surface and their data recovered) by comparing memory readings to those transmitted at surface. This confirmed that the data available at surface was not altered by the telemetry system and remained within the resolution of transmission (0.001 psi) throughout the test, as shown on Fig. 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The second step, when applicable and if not performed before running the DST string in hole is to perforate the target interval(s) and establish communication with the formation. The pressure response can be taken as a strong indicator of valve closure and opening, creation of static underbalance, reception of pressure pulse used to trigger the firing head, or confirmation of firing itself. This sequence is illustratedin Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">In addition, temperature data is also very useful to identify when injected fluids pumped at cooler temperature from surface are passing the gauge and arriving at the formation to be stimulated. An example is presented in Fig. 8. This example clearly illustrates the drop in injection pressure as the acid reacts with the formation and eases inflow during bullheading operations, demonstrating the success of stimulation operations.</p><div id="link-8">

The buildup was clean and easy to interpret, even considering the uncertainty in input flow rates. The response showed that the primary reason for the minimal flow rates was the tightness of the formation, with only a moderate skin factor.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The lift model was built from the actual DST string design, used the quick-look analysis result to obtain an estimate of well and formation properties, and thus estimated rates ahead of time. Furthermore, the well performance model could be tuned from the availability of downhole as well as surface data, leading to relevant prediction performances (Fig. 10).</p><div id="link-10">
