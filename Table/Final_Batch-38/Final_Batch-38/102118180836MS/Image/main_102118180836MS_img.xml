<anchoringText id="Ancr1">Reservoir Context Reservoir 1 is a high porosity (20-30%), Pleistocene sand deposited in a high net to gross, delta front environment. This sand is gas bearing, extending across two communicating fault blocks within the field (Figure 1). The two wells completed in the reservoir stopped producing by becoming liquid loaded due to water breakthrough. After 8 years of production, the gas recovery when benchmarked against local analogues had potentially low sweep efficiency.</anchoringText>

<caption>Well 1 Reservoir 1 Saturation Log Results: This shaly sand was originally gas charged when logged in open hole. Note high resistivity and associated low Sw (blue curve in Saturation track) in cleaner sands, this initial condition was corroborated by saturation height function derived water saturation models (green SW_SHF_SP and red SW_SHF curves). In 2015 the through tubing Saturation log shows very little remaining gas saturation (SG SAT LOG black curve with red shading).</caption>

Numerous faults create structural complexity across the reservoir as shown in Figure 5. This sand is gas bearing, underlain by a thin oil rim approximately 30 ft. thick. The producers were completed in the oil rim through a drilling campaign primarily targeting oil recovery.</anchoringText>

<caption>Well A Reservoir 3 Saturation Log Results: This interval was originally all gas filled. The computed gas saturations (red shading) indicate the gas liquid contact has moved up to the thin shale (blue dashed line indicating GLC uncertainty). The oil rim is expected to have been displaced upwards by the aquifer. The remaining high oil saturation zones can be identified by intervals of high carbon oxygen ratio. The SW derived from this ratio is SWCO shown in magenta, shaded in green. If SW is low but gas saturation is low, the only fluid remaining is oil. The highest oil saturations are therefore in the sand lobe below the current GLC. Higher water saturation is expected with water cut below the shale indicated by solid blue lines.</caption>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">Reservoir Context Reservoir 4 is a good quality reservoir, with high net to gross and porosity values, deposited in a delta front environment. Fault blocks (FB) X and Y both contain large gas caps, underlain by thin oil rims (Figure 7). These oil rims were the target of primary depletion within the reservoirs via numerous wells, across both fault blocks. After eleven years on production the oil recovery from Reservoir 4 benchmarked well against technical analogues for primary oil depletion.</anchoringText>

<caption>Well A and B Reservoir 4 Saturation Log Results: The gas saturation computed from the Saturation log shows a significant increase above the red dashed line for each well. This indicates the current GWC. The oil rim is qualitatively identified by comparing the actual sigma measured with the 100% wet sigma computed from open hole logs. The difference, highlighted in green, is either gas or oil. Combining the two hydrocarbon indicators identifies remaining oil saturation below the current GWC. The terminology of ʺcontactʺ is actually a misnomer in this formation below the current GWC, where three phases are active. The interval just below the current GWC is actually a ʺsmeared zoneʺ, formerly gas filled, that will produce oil with high GOR, initially at low water cut. The green dashed lines identifies where oil saturation is very low due to aquifer encroachment, approximating the current OWC.</caption>
