The fire line overburden of thick reservoir is obvious (Yue Qingshan et al., 2000)and the thicker the thickness the more obvious the fire line overburden for its over 60m reservoir model. When the thickness of oil layer is over 20m, the override of fire line is obvious, furthermore, the upper limit of reservoir thickness is determined to be 20m (Refer to figure9). The thickness of the reservoir in G3 block is more than 60m, general gas injection in whole section will lead to override of fire line, and the interlayer is not well developed, so there is no good geological condition for oil extraction from the bottom up (Refer to figure8). We can inject gas to the small layer at top postion, thus it can increase the gas storage in per unit, regain formation pressure, replenish formation energy, and is good for high temperature oxidation(TURTA A T, 2008).</p><div id="link-7">
