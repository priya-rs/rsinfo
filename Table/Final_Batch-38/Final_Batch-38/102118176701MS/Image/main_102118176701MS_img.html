<p id="Ancr3">There exist maximum and minimal stresses, which are oriented perpendicular to each other. With maximum stress vectors far exceeding minimum stress vectors hydraulic fractures are formed along the maximum stress vectors (angle α up to 5°) and, accordingly, perpendicular to the least principal stress (Fig. 1a). If stress values are approximately the same, hydraulic fractures will extend at α angle of 45 degrees (Fig. 1b) (Abass et al., 1996; Daneshy, 2013; El Rabaa, 1998, Fritz et al., 1991; Soliman et al., 1990).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Wellbore orientation relative to maximum in-situ stress vector was such that multiple hydraulically induced fractures initiated at β angle between 0° and 90° for both simulation cases (Fig. 2). Moreover, in presence of natural fractures the displacement front propagates along the fractures; consequently, orientation of induced fractures with respect to natural fracture direction which may not coincide with maximum in-situ stress vector becomes more important (Fig. 2b).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">According to simulation studies, in absence of natural fractures the displacement front moves uniformly along each layer of a porous reservoir upon achieving hydraulic fractures. If these fractures propagate along the horizontal wellbore (β = 0°); i.e., maximum in-situ stress vector is parallel to the horizontal wellbore, oil and water production, oil recovery and the rate of water cut increase are the lowest (Fig. 3), which is attributable to unfavorable reservoir sweep efficiency and longer displacement front propagation path.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">In presence of natural fractures the displacement front moves along the fractures, in which case the matrix exhibits good imbibition capacity only in case of water-wet reservoir. Similar simulation studies were performed for a fractured reservoir. If multiple hydraulic fractures are initiated at β = 0°, which means that maximum in-situ stress vector is parallel to the predominant natural fracture direction; oil and water production, oil recovery and water cut increase rates are the lowest (Fig. 4), and they are the highest at β = 90°.</p><div id="link-4">

This horizontal well intersected the thickest part of the target reservoir in the purely oil-saturated zone (Fig. 5). Once the drilling was completed, four-stage hydraulic fracturing was performed. As seen in Fig. 6, hydraulic fractures propagated at 30–60 degree angles relative to horizontal wellbore.

<p id="Ancr9">Hydraulic fracturing is performed in the main wellbore, and the fracture created by such treatment is in the vertical plane. Then a horizontal sidetrack is drilled in the direction of the thickest oil-saturated reservoir portion, and production string is run in hole until the distance C from the main fracture plane is within the range 100–300 m (Fig. 7). According to simulation studies, the C distance of less than 100 m causes rapid water cut increase, while C distance of more than 300 m impedes adequate reservoir pressure maintenance. Oil recovery decreases in both cases.</p><div id="link-7">

Simulations of multistage fracturing showed that for various geological and physical reservoir characteristics horizontal wellbore placement within the smaller angle between natural and hydraulically induced fractures increases well operation time to 100% water cut due to the longest water flow pathway through fractures.</p><div id="link-9">
