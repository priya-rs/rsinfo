<p id="Ancr6">The G-field is a brown field, located in the offshore depobelt of the Niger Delta (Fig. 1). The field was discovered in 1981 and production commenced in 1985. Sixteen different reservoirs have so far been penetrated by 25 wells in the field. The trapping mechanism is predominantly structurally controlled. The field is characterized by synthetic faults which trend in the east-west with south ward throws. The lithologies are interlayered sequence of sand and shales. The regional seismic across the field (Fig. 2) in dip section with the arbitrary lines shows the fault orientations with different pressure cell within each fault block.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">In all the post-drill pore pressure and fracture gradient models for all the wells, the first log track on the formation pressuregradient model presents the gamma-ray log track (Fig. 4). The gamma-ray logs served as lithology indicator. The second log track is the resistivity log track which was used to measure the formation resistivity and conductivity in the borehole containing oil and fresh water. In this track, the shale points were filtered using the moving weight average method in order to generate the Normal Compaction Trend from the resistivity logs.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">The total depth interval for Well 02 ranges from 1190-13500 feet TVD. An interpretation of the pore pressure model shows gradual increase in pore pressure gradient from onset of the section, with value ranging from 8.3ppg to maximum of 8.89ppg with an average shale pore pressure of 8.5ppg (Fig. 5). This is a normally pressured zone. The normally pressured zone was detected between 1299 and 9820 feet TVD. Based on the empirical model, an over pressured zone was detected from 9825-13582 feet TVD.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr13">The decrease of the shale-resistivity behind the established NCTline from resistivity logs indicates the overpressured zones (Fig. 8). Also, the deviations of the shale resistivity logs from the established NCT line towards the higher values scale indicate the normal pressure zone which may be attributed to the presence of different lithologies of shale and sandstone interbeds. This procedure was applicable to all wells. The compressional wave velocity (Vp) from the sonic logs was used to delineate the abnormal pressure zone and the normal pressure zone within the interval sections.</p><div id="link-8">
