<p id="Ancr2">The Hai Thach and Moc Tinh fields are located in blocks 05-2 and 05-3 in Nam Con Son basin, offshore Vietnam, as shown in Fig. 1. Gas-condensate accumulation occurs in multiple Upper, Middle, and Lower Miocene sandstone reservoirs. Some of the reservoirs are expected to produce formation water before abandonment. The production facilities of both Hai Thach and Moc Tinh fields were designed for a minimal sand production rate of 0.1 lb/MMscf.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">There are four different plays within Blocks 05-2 and 05-3, namely Oligocene fluvial/deltaic play, Miocene deltaic/shallow marine play, Miocene syn-rift turbidite play, and Miocene post-rift turbidite play, as illustrated in Fig. 2. Of these four plays, only the three Miocene plays are current producing reservoirs in Hai Thach and Moc Tinh fields.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Five cores from five wells penetrating four different reservoirs were comprehensively tested using unconfined compression tests, triaxial tests, and TWC tests. Sample size for unconfined compression tests and triaxial tests was 1.0 inch in diameter and 2.0-2.5 inches in length. Sample size for TWC tests was 1.5 inches in outer diameter, 0.5 inches in inner diameter, and 3.0 inches in length. It was found that typical UCS for Upper Miocene, Middle Miocene, and Lower Miocene sandstone was 2500-3000 psi, 7000 psi, and 5000 psi, respectively. It was also observed that all three Miocene plays follow the same trend of TWC vs. UCS, as shown in Fig. 3. A power-law best fit was determined based on the TWC vs. UCS data and used in subsequent modeling.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The workflow for sand potential modeling is presented in Fig. 5. The analysis revealed that Hai Thach and Moc Tinh sandstone reservoirs have moderate sanding potential and some sand production would likely occur before abandonment, especially in Upper Miocene reservoirs. Therefore, field implementation and close monitoring is critical for production optimization while ensuring safety of production facilities.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Acoustic emission transducer sensors were instrumented on wellhead flowlines of all production wells. The system compares the noise travelling through the pipes to calibrated baselines of sand-free production. If the noise level is higher than the baseline, a sanding rate will be estimated. Finally, an alarm will be automatically activated if the sand rate reaches a pre-determined threshold, as shown in Fig. 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">All production wells are monitored real-time by both offshore production crew and onshore engineers. Monitoring parameters can be customized for each well depending on its particular performance and concerns. Typically, the monitoring includes choke size, downhole gauge pressure, downhole gauge temperature, wellhead pressure, wellhead temperature, and sanding rate, as shown in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">In addition to real-time monitoring, basic sediment and water (BS&amp;W) measurements are also taken during regular well tests. If the amount of sediment is noticeable, further investigation will be carried out to check for sand production. Finally, the sanding potential for production wells is reviewed every month, as shown in Fig. 8. The bottomhole pressure (BHP) was maintained within the sand-free operating envelope as well as above a performance-based BHP limit determined from multi-rate well tests to maximize condensate production and reduce water production.</p><div id="link-8">
