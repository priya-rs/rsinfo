It can be observed that the reservoir rocks were well consolidated, therefore justifying the use of Willson et al. (2002) approach. If the rocks had been weakly consolidated or unconsolidated, other analyses might have been required.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> Description of available cores for geomechanics testing</p><p>Table 1 Description of available cores for geomechanics testing</p><table id="102118186387MS-Tbl_SPi-1" frame="hsides">
