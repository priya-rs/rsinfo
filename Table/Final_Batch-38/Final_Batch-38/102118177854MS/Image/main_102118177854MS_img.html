<p id="Ancr4">In this paper, we will primarily concentrate on Field N (shown in Figure 1), located in the Northwest part of North Kuwait fields. All wells selected for the restrospective study are rich in reservoir characterization data, have been stimulated and yielded mixed results, and are within close proximity to one another. As a result, any findings from the retrospective can be attributed to sub-optimal stimulation design due to limited understanding of reservoir heterogeneity, and thus will provide good basis for an optimization strategy.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">Multidisciplinary optimization workflow starts with looking back at prior stimulation treatments along with petrophysical and geomechanic re-evaluation, and compared to the relative production performance as the key performance indicator (KPI). Optimization process involves understanding the causes of good as well as subpar performance from wells, by integrating the performance results with reservoir quality, completion quality, and stimulation designs. By taking a holistic approach in understanding the problem, we can provide an optimized strategy to any field. In Figure 4, we can see the workflow followed in optimizing stimulation designs to achieve better results.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 5a. and b. summarize the production performance (pre and post stimulation) and the resultant FOI for nine stages completed. Due to the extremely tight nature of these HPHT Dolomites, most stages show little-to-no production prior to stimulation treatment, hence skewing the FOI. However, the inconsistency of results is of importance. Variation in pre-stimulation production could be attributed to heterogeneity in reservoir quality, which will be addressed later in this paper.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Analysis of the summary in Table 3 indicates well N2 to be the most suitable in terms of RQ (especially perf 2b in terms of porosity and hydrocarbon saturation). However, well N3 is the best in terms of natural fracture development. Well N3 is also seen to be the best producer post stimulation and this seems to tie to the presence of high density discontinuous natural fractures (possibly enhanced post stimulation). Figure 6 shows an integrated log composite of well N2 with HRA and all input logs used as input to generate the HRA.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">In order to understand the vertical and lateral variation of both the mechanical properties and the in-situ stresses, to provide reliable parameters for the fracturing design, four 1D-MEMs were built in the field N. The mechanical properties were calibrated with the core data available in one of the wells. In Figure 9, we can see that good agreement between the estimated correlation and the core data was achieved. However, it is important to note that no core data was available specifically in the HPHT Dolomite formation.</p><div id="link-9">

Tectonic parameters were adjusted to reproduce the failure observed (breakouts) during drilling and the fracture diagnostic tests measurements and the post fracturing behavior. The operational window shows good agreement between the breakouts interpreted in the image log (last track) and the synthetic image estimated using the 1D-MEM model (sixth track). Both Breakdown and closure pressures also show a reasonable agreement with the operational window.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">The behavior of the mechanical properties for the HPHT Dolomite formation is presented in Fig 11. As you can see, input data is quite consistent between the wells, across the wells. And hence, we should be able to apply the core correlation to all wells, though it was measured on only one well. Once necessary property correction from core was performed, the input logs are then used to build 1D-MEM in several wells across the field.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr15">Figure 12 shows the variation of the Young’s Modulus (YME) in the HPHT Dolomite formation. As can be noticed the vertical variation in YME is ranging from ~ 1 Mpsi to _ 10 Mpsi, this variation will impact the behavior of the stresses with depth and can even lead to stress rotation, stress variability vertically and across the field, can even lead to a complex localized stress regime heterogeneity along the wellbore. This phenomenon has large impact on completion strategy and interval perforation selection to optimize both fracture initiation and propagation in order to generate a really effective conductivity between the formation and the well.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr17">To address production variation in Lower Dolomite, we follow the same approach of analysis. However, due to the lack of 1D-MEM in all candidate wells, we will consider only four wells which have the re-calibrated 1D-MEM. Figure 14 shows CQ Class variation across the Lower Dolomite formation in four wells. As with the Middle Dolomite case, by comparing CNP across perforations between the wells, we should be able to rank them and correlate to the production. </p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr21">To understand the effect and impact of natural fractures on production, a static reservoir model for well N-2 with Lower Dolomite formation as target was constructed. In a numerical simulator, pre-stimulation rate from Well Test was matched to calibrate the reservoir model. Once a calibrated model was obtained, acid fracturing was modeled (in a reservoir-centric stimulation design tool) and production was forecasted for the same geometry. From Figure 18, we can see that, oil production for a pure matrix driven system (~300 bopd) falls well below Well Test (~1,400 bopd).</p><div id="link-18">
