<p id="Ancr1">Considering the above, it was decided to drill horizontal production wells in a row pattern. To make production cost-effective, boost productivity of wells and involve all reservoirs, horizontal wells need to be multi-fracked. (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Inflow to a multi-fracked horizontal is characterized by several filtration modes, going in succession (Figure 2), which differ by the type of flow symmetry: linear, the first transition (elliptical), an early radial, the second transition, pseudoradial. Under favorable conditions, the time interval in which manifested each mode is determined by the results of «log-log» diagnostics its characteristic angle asymptotes in a logarithmic derivative.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">In general terms, it boils down to identifying the two radial modes of filtration during long-term monitoring of the hydrodynamic operation of the well. Just the number of working fractures is determined by the ratio of crack permeability mode is determined according to (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr14">This method has been implemented at more than 40 wells, by now. It allows not only to substantiate start-up production rates of wells, but also to forecast their further operation even at an early operating stage, which allows to plan further field development with greater accuracy. This approach is trustworthy, as demonstrated by the high matching percentage of forecast and actual indicators (Fig. 15).</p><div id="link-14">
