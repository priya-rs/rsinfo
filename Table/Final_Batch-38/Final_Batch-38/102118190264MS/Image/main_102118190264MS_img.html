<p id="Ancr4">The long WIFs may be caused by plugging effects, depletion (poro-elastic), thermal effects, and so on (Gadde and Sharma 2001; Hustedt et al. 2006; Baker et al. 2016). As shown by Wright et al. (1999) in West Texas by tiltmeter data, the half-length of the WIFs are a surprising 450 to 650 ft (70-100% of well spacing) as seen in Fig. 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Fig. 2 shows an example in a certain oilfield. The inverted nine-spot pattern is adopted in this field (Fig. 2 (a)). Influenced by WIFs in West-East direction, the performances of production wells in different positions are totally different. Quick water breakthrough, accompanied with low oil rate and high water cut, occurs in producers along the WIF direction (Fig. 2 (b)) while long-term low production is sustained for producers that perpendicular to WIF (Fig. 2 (c)). Therefore, such dynamic behaviors of WIFs need to be timely and carefully evaluated in the waterflooding program.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">The pressure responses for Well A in 2006 and 2008 are shown in Fig. 4, which behave as composite model reservoir. The matching and interpretation results are given in Fig. 4 and Table 1. If the mobility ratio of water region is equal to the reservoir oil or the inner radius is relatively small, the pressure behavior may behave as homogenous reservoir. However, the mobility of water injected always has a significant difference with reservoir oil, which reflects in two aspects:</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">There are six producers named B1, B2, B3, B4, B5, and B6 around injector Well A (Fig. 5(a)). The production histories of Well B1, B4 and B6 are given in Fig. 5(b)(c)(d). It is shown that the water cut of Well B1 surged from 14.18% to 53.44% in Dec. 09 while the water cut of Well B4 soared from 0 to 92.67%in Oct. 09. The unexpected and abrupt water breakthrough in B1 and B4 suggests that the WIF may be induced in B1-A-B4 direction, which is line with the maximum principle stress direction.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">The unexpected and abrupt water breakthrough in B1 and B4 suggests that the WIF may be induced in B1-A-B4 direction, which is line with the maximum principle stress direction. The performances of the producers in the two sides of B1-A-B4 are quite different with Well B1 and B4. Taking B6 as a representative, the production history is plotted in Fig. 6(d), which shows stable oil production and water cut. The distinct behaviors between these wells confirms the existence of WIF in B1-A-B4 direction again. These performances validate the evolution of WIF during water injection process.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">The pressure behavior of water injection well C is shown in Fig. 7. The pressure and its derivative curves coincide as unit slope and last about three log cycles, which signifies the severe storage effect. After the early storage effect, pressure and its derivative curves show a small opening. This illustrates the poor flow condition in the reservoir. Due to the large storage effect, the true reservoir response is masked completely. Saphir (Ecrin 2011) is used to match this pressure behavior (see Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">

Pressure and its derivative curve coincide in the early time and then separate, followed by the upward of pressure derivative curve in the late time, which is generally considered as the existence of closed boundary near the well. However, it has already validated that there is no long fracture or fault found around this well by analyzing the performances of its adjacent wells.</p><div id="link-8">
