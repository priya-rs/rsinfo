<p id="Ancr2">Casabe has been under waterflooding since 1980. Injection rates declined dramatically after 10 years struggling with the injection vertical profile which allow only 3.4% of recovery factor due to waterflooding as shown in Fig. 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">ILTs represent the basis for the evaluation of injection allocation in Casabe. In each well the aim is to have at least 3 ILTs per year. When a negative event like abrupt high BSW is identified in a producer, an ILT is run in each injector in the entire pattern. Water flow regulators have failed on a regular basis and abnormal high rates are found like shown in Fig. 6 where two regulators are in 390% and 2247% over injecting generating injectivities of 38 bbl/ft and 107 bbl/ft respectively being the injectivity recommended for this sands no more than 10 bbl/ft.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 7 illustrates an example of the information obtained from “swabbing”. A portion of a well log with perforations are shown in the central track. Due to the flowing condition the packers were located from bottom to top identifying three flowing zones. In the boxes next to the identified flowing zones are the lab results shown. Considering costs it was not possible to continue evaluating individual layers this was therefore done in groups by correlation with injection zones. In this case the upper zone produce 7% of sediments with 85% of water cut. Based on the amount of sediments the zone was closed from the injectors.</p><div id="link-7">

But it was not possible to identify which of the four injectors caused the channeling. The neighbor producers were not affected by closing A3 which means the preferential flow is only toward one producer.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">A pattern was selected in Block 3 (Fig. 10) to inject tracers in two layers (A2 and A2i) of four injector wells, eight different tracers in total. From the monitoring of breakthrough of tracers in first line producers (Fig. 11) it was confirmed that preferential flow in layer A2i was taking place. The breakthrough took place in less than 7 days and almost 90% of the tracer mass was recovered (Fig. 12). This represents an almost total recirculation in one layer. In terms of conductivity it can be said that 20% of the pore volume conduct 60% of the total flow (Fig. 13).</p><div id="link-10">
