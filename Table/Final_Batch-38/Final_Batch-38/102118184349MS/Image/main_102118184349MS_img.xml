Sand on sand juxtaposition was established across some faults between the green and brown reservoirs (Figure 3). Fault seal analysis between both of them showed there is inter reservoir communication based on low SGR (0.3) and relatively high FTM (0.7) values (Figures 4 and 5). There is no possibility of vertical communication as the shale between the reservoirs is competent and laterally extensive. This has led to the pressure from the green field reservoir to be depleted by wells in the brown field one (Figure 7).</anchoringText>
