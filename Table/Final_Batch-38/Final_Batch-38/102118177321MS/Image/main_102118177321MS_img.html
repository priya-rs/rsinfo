The Marcellus is divided into West Virginia, West Pennsylvania, North Pennsylvania, and South Pennsylvania. The Utica is divided into Dry Gas, Lean Condensate, Rich Condensate, and Oily. The production areas fall within the states of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Ohio. The geographic locations of the breakouts are provided in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

The majority of this crude oil can be classified as condensate. Refineries in the region will struggle to accommodate the growing volumes of light crude oil, as they are particularly tooled for heavier crude oil from Canada.</p><div id="link-13">
