<p id="Ancr5">Figure 1 shows the large areal variations in the dominant semidiurnal M2 and dirnal K1 components. Moreover there are two semidiurnal amphidromic points (position of zero amplitude) near 25°N 53°E and 28°N 50°E, and a single amphidromic point for the diurnal tide near 51°N 27°E. This has a profound impact on the nature of the tide in the Gulf. Tides are classified by using the ratio of the amplitudes of the main diurnal constituents K1 and O1 to that of the two main semi-diurnal amplitudes M2 and S2 known as the “form ratio”.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Defant (1961) gives the following classification for categorizing the type of tide: semi-diurnal for F &lt; 0.25; mixed, mainly semi-diurnal for F between 0.25 and 1.5; mixed, mainly diurnal for F between 1.5 and 3.0; and diurnal for F &gt; 3.0. According to Figure 2 the tide is generally mixed except close to the semidiurnal points where the tide is diurnal and close to the diurnal amphidromic point where the tide is semidiurnal.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">Field A is very close to the diurnal amphidromic and experiences only one tide per day (F=3.5). This is clearly evident from bottomhole pressure measurements (Figure 3). Spectral analysis of the detrended pressure from well#1 test#4 (Figure 4) reveals a strong diurnal component and a very weak semidiurnal. Tidal recordings are available from 3 stations: Zirku, M1 and Al Mubarraz some 40 to 80 km from Field A The harmonic analysis of these stations was conducted by Poux et al. (Table 2). The tide type changes drastically from being mixed at M1 and Al Mubarraz to diurnal at Zirku while the amplitude of M2 decreases from 31 cm to 11 cm. In order to capture this trend, the harmonic constituents, both ampltides and phases, were linearly interpolated to Field A (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-3">

The tidal removal procedures of Levithan and Phan with the spline model, and Zhao and Reynolds with the two log model were tested on some build-ups and interference tests. Some of the responses are complex with early pressure build-up followed by depletion from interfering wells (Figure 6) or depletion followed by repressurization after shutting neighbouring wells (Figure 7). The two log model is inappropriate to fit this non-monotonous behavior.

<p id="Ancr15">Table 3 summarises the PTA and tidal analysis. We notice from Figure 11 an increasing trend of tidal efficiency with KH from 0.08 to 0.24. Indeed the diffusive fractures improve the matrix KH, typically by a factor of 10, while fracture corridors enhance it by more than 100. Thus high KH is indicative of fractures near the well. These fractures increase the rock compressibility and produce a higher tidal efficiency (Equation 3). Also flank wells well#5, 6 and 7 have higher tidal efficiencies than wells with similar KH at the crest.</p><div id="link-11">
