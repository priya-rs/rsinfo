<p id="Ancr7">China has been the second largest economy entity since 2010. Together with the economy development increase is the energy consumption. As is shown in Figure 1(BP 2017), oil consumption per capital of China is expected to grow rapidly. However, oil consumption is related with the development degree. Figure 1 also shows that the more developed, the more oil consumption per capita, except for entities abundant in oil and gas.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 2 (CNPC 2016) shows China energy consumption in the past and future. Coal has been the major fuel for the long time in the past and will remain to be the major fuel in the near and long future. Currently, 40% primary energy in China comes from coal, which is generally regarded to produce more carbon emissions than other fuels. Emissions from coal in northern China is regarded as one of the major contaminants in air smog, which has been a serious topic in winter for years. The high coal share in primary energy consumption is also due to the abundance of coal in China.</p><div id="link-2">

Polymer flooding and ASP flooding production in 2016 by Daqing Oilfield was 850 million tons and 407 million tons respectively, and this year's polymer utility factor (UF) was 47.3 ton/ton, higher than 47 for three years (Zhang 2017). Figure 20 shows polymer utility factor since 1996.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr28">According to latest information, there are 9170 ASP flooding wells (injectors and producers) in Daqing (Qi 2018). Figure 22 shows ASP flooding development history in Daqing. Field practice of ASP flooding in Daqing is reviewed previously (Hu et al. 2017a,b). One important issue regarding with ASP flooding is the alkali selection. Typical two ASP flooding field tests in Daqing using different alkalis (NaOH and Na2CO3) are shown in Figure 23 (Hu et al. 2017c). This figure shows that water cut decreased drastically in ASP flooding, and Na2CO3 ASP flooding had bigger water cut reduction than NaOH.</p><div id="link-22">
