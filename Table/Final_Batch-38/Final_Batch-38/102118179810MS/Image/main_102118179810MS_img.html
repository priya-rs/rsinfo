<p id="Ancr7">Field structure map and a typical crestal area Reservoir Data Log (RDL) are given in Figure 1 and Figure 2, respectively. The large in place volumes combined with the reservoir and performance uncertainties resulted in a requirement for a phased approach to field development. FID (final investment decision) for Phased field development was given for the construction of the Production Station with liquid capacity designed for 1890 m3/d and gas handling capacity of 775 km3/d, in addition to 7 producing wells. The main objective was to assess the dynamic characteristics of the Athel reservoir under primary depletion. The field came on stream in the year 2000 and is developed with vertical wells with multiple massive hydraulic fractures. All the proposed wells for Phase 1 development are located in the crestal of the reservoir.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">Currently the available facilities accommodate around 45 production wells on an area approximately 3 square kilometers (1, 5 km × 2 km). The oil treatment facilities are situated at the edge of the production well area to south east (Figure 3). The station is currently producing oil with associated gas. The gas produced is sour gas (H2S) and treated (sweetened) and reused, exported or flared during down times.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The QRA study demonstrated that two of the three evaluated locations (i.e. option 2B and option 3) are just above 1E-04 per year LSIR (Location Specific Individual Risk) contour and 1E-04 p3er year of 650ppm of H2S whereas option 2D is overlapping with the above mentioned contours (i.e. yellow zone in Figure 4). In general, having the proposed locations, which has lower LSIR contour than 1E-04 per year of 650ppm, would allow construction of the new process units without a need to shut-down the existing facilities.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr15">Concept selection for Phase 3B, however, depends mainly on Phase 3A injection performance. Phase 3A will provide valuable information to allow optimization of Phase 3B. The key for success of Phase 3A is the ability to measure the effectiveness of the MGI, in terms of translating the measured oil rate and GOR in terms of sweep efficiency. This requires a detailed history match. Updated subsurface models, updated cost estimates, and an assessment of gas availability will be the input into Phase 3B concept selection and FID. This is illustrated in the following “development decision tree” in Figure 9:</p><div id="link-9">
