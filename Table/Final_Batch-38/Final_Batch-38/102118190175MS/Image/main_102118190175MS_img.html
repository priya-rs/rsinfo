<p id="Ancr5">The SUCS can easily be differentiated from the underlying LCS by a slight lower gamma ray profile (lower clay content), higher resistivity and different heavy mineral families. The two reservoirs are either separated by the debrites deposits and/or the Mid Captain Shale (Figure 2). Production data (e.g pressure and PLT information) shows that LCS and SUCS reservoirs have limited communication.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">One of the goals of the pilot was to see if polymer injection could cause an unambiguous response in terms of changing water cuts. Therefore, the water cut development for waterflood was established before starting the polymer flood using decline curve analysis (DCA). This allowed the waterflood baseline production to be calculated using actual gross offtake rates. Figure 6 shows the water cut in the pilot producer from start of water flood and through the pilot duration. The matched and predicted equivalent waterflood response is also included for comparison.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Another observation is the continuous increase in injection pressure during polymer injection (Figure 7). Some increase was expected as the bank of viscous oil and polymer evolves and transports through the reservoir. In October 2011, the wellhead pressure became constrained by the water injection manifold pressure on the Captain platform and the injection rate declined. The BHP pressure increase exceeded what was predicted and consequently an analytic tool was developed to predict the pressure of future injection wells based on a calibration to the pilot performance. However, this performance led to an increased focus on chemical product quality and acceptance criteria, as demonstrated and remedied by Dwarakanath et al.,</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr15">This equation was calibrated against the field data to more accurately predict the pressure performance during polymer injection for the Captain Field. Pressure prediction is important because there are limitations on injection pressure (i.e. facility and subsurface constraints) which once reached impose an injection rate decline. As made clear in the design and preparation of the EOR pilot, processing rate is critical for successful chemical flooding. Likewise, an accurate forecast for injection rate is necessary for astute engineering decisions regarding field economics. Figure 12 below shows both the actual pressure recorded in the pilot injector and the predicted pressure leading up to the injection manifold pressure limitation and start of rate decline as a result.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr16">As a check on decline curve results, the theory developed by Koval (1963) was modified for use in immiscible floods. In 1963 Koval proposed a measure of heterogeneity for unstable miscible displacements; however, if the flow is segregated, the theory can be applied to immiscible displacements as well. There is some evidence from recent logging that flow in Captain can be treated as segregated. Figure 13 below shows water saturation along the length for an injection well in the Upper Captain Sand; one can see the saturation profile is essentially binary; oil is either swept or unswept with displacing fluid contact, with a very small transition in between. This field data supports that using segregated flow conditions is reasonable.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr18">Polymer has been injected continuously as plotted schematically in Figure 15. We estimate polymer flood swept volume by treating the produced polymer history as a continuous tracer and applying an analytic (complementary error function) solution to 1-D transport. This 1-D solution is a reasonable assumption because the wells are horizontal with uniform injection/production (observed in PLT data) and geologic studies of the SUCS reservoir describe it is very homogeneous and able to be represented with a low Lorenz coefficient (Lc) = 0.37. For a continuous tracer injection, solution to the 1-D Convection-Dispersion (C-D) equation can be written as:</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr19">The C-D equation assumes 1-D flow with a single source and sink, and full recovery of the injected fluids. There is an abundance of evidence there is flow from outside the pilot zone. For example, for the majority of the polymer flood the C43 injection / C47 production was relatively balanced; however, there is a substantial departure from this in Q2 2013 (Figure 16). This dilution effect must be captured to estimate swept volume and accurately determine oil production from the pilot.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr20">If VRR is not maintained at unity, it is clear all produced fluids cannot be from C43. As a first pass at accounting for the dilution effect, we multiply the polymer concentration obtained from Equation 4 by a 7-day averaged VRR. The procedure is like that described briefly above, except the misfit function is now (Cobs – CCD*VRR)2. The resulting match is given in Figure 17 below. Except for the final week’s data, the match is considered excellent. The resulting swept volume is 7.6 MMSTB and represents the volume of the reservoir contacted by the injected polymer, or Vp*(1-So). Taking So at 0.26 (the tangent to the polymer-oil P50 fractional flow curve), and accounting for the polymer inaccessible pore volume and adsorption (‘D4’, -0.05 PV) gives a total swept pore volume of 9.8 MMSTB or 4.7 MMSTB incremental to the WF.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr21">Therefore, the pilot oil production is calculated as qo*VRR where qo is the C47 oil rate. This implies the water cut is the same in either production stream. Given the maturity of the flood (&gt;1 PV injected), this assumption is considered acceptable. Figure 18 below shows the total oil produced from C47 and the ‘pilot only’ cumulative oil produced through Nov 2013. Because a large slug of polymer was injected, it is expected to continue producing ‘pilot oil’ until the water fingers through the polymer as subsequently observed.</p><div id="link-18">

If the displacing bank is in VE between the well pair, then the viscosity of the polymer is sufficiently high and being maintained to mobilize the target bypassed oil. This well confirmed the mid case used for the assessment above as well as excellent vertical conformance of the flood, sweeping the complete reservoir interval from top-to-bottom.
