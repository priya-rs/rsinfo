These intervals are referred to as toe (CFT 1600/2100), mid-toe (CFT 1400/1500), mid-heel (CFT 1900/2200), and heel (CFT 2000/2400).

<p id="Ancr10">When a well was flowed back, its neighboring western well(s) remained shut-in and thus had a higher [reservoir] pressure. Furthermore, the well’s neighboring eastern well(s) was already flowed back or producing and thus had a lower pressure. This created an eastward flow preference, shown schematically in Figure 6. In the tracer data, there is a general trend for a larger mass percent transfer from the western well to the eastern well. To quantify this trend, a ratio, communication index (CI), was defined:</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">Figure 8 shows the mass percent of CFT 1500 recovered as a function of distance. The point lying on the y-axis is indicating that 2% of CFT 1500, which was injected into 6N, was recovered out of 6N (self-recovery). In general, there is a trend that shows a negative correlation between mass percent recovered and lateral distance from the reference well. However, in the case of CFT 1500, there are a handful of outliers, all of which lie to the east of 6N.</p><div id="link-8">

<figcaption><b>Figure 8 </b> Mass percent recovered v. distance (CFT 1500). CFT 1500 was injected into an interval along the 6N lateral located in the graben structure. Notice that there are certain instances where a well that was laterally further away from where CFT 1500 was located, yet recovered a larger mass percent. For example, well 3C, which was located slightly over 1000 lateral feet from 6N, recovered a larger mass percent of CFT 1500 despite two other wells that were laterally closer at 600 and 800 feet. This is due to the east to west completion and flowback schedule.</figcaption>

CFT 2500, which was injected along the entire lateral of 7N is not included in this figure.

<p id="Ancr16">In well 6N, fractures were generally very efficient except for those in the heel region. Again, the graben structure may have contributed to the ease of fracture creation, as the mid-toe and mid-heel regions have the highest efficiencies. The efficiency in the heel region is extremely poor, comparatively at 21.1%. This may be due to the fact that it is completely out of zone or encounters more ductile rock (Figure 12). However, the overall flow efficiency is higher in 6N than 2N, indicating that the production from 6N should be higher than 2N as the average EFFL for both wells are relatively similar. As of March 2016, the cumulative production of 6N and 2N is 185 and 178 mBOE, respectively.</p><div id="link-12">
