<p id="Ancr4">The four liquid loaded wells were completed in deltaic reservoirs with excellent reservoir properties; net to gross ranging from 85 to 98%, porosities in the range of 22 to 28% and permeabilities in the order of hundreds of millidarcies. Well correlations and seismic mapping suggest that each reservoir is connected to a regional aquifer, with the aquifer impacting at the base of the hydrocarbon column and/or at the northwestern and southeastern edges of the accumulation as shown in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The analysis of Pressure Transient Data collected over the production life of the wells, as illustrated in Figure 2, also supports this interpretation of the aquifer geometry. As discussed in Roopa and Baksh 201210, the derivative overlays revealed that there was a reduction in permeability-thickness which was interpreted as evidence of bottom water drive. There was also an inward movement of the late time region unit slope, that is, the unit slope starts earlier, indicative of an edge water drive mechanism.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Selecting appropriate shales to set the water shut off plugs across proved to be challenging. This was compounded by high net to gross of the reservoirs across the completion intervals as illustrated in Figure 3. However, like most clastic reservoirs, intervening shales with true vertical thicknesses ranging from five to twenty feet were present. They could be correlated between the available, yet limited, offset wells to a maximum of two thousand feet away.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The target depth of the plug was chosen within an interbedded shale in the reservoir to provide reduced vertical permeability to water flow into the completion as shown in Figure 4. A collar section of the screen, that is a solid section of the base pipe, within the shale zone was also a criteria used to select the target depth. Anchoring the tool string at this point ensured an ideal fixed point to set the plug and also created a longer section for water bypass.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">Otherwise, where the length of the sealing element was not considered critical, an Interwell Retrievable Bridge Plug, shown in Appendix Figure 6, for high pressure/high temperature applications as described by Robinson, Gray, and Bill 20159 was installed in a screen joint. These plugs used a mechanical method to exert force on the sealing element, thereby causing it to expand against the joint.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Two types of plugs were ultimately considered; swellable and expandable. The TAM Freecap swellable packer, shown in Appendix Figure 7, was used in instances where a longer sealing length (~ 20 feet) was required. The TAM assembly was anchored by a Magna Range Bridge plug which was designed to pass through the smallest restriction in the work string, usually, the formation isolation valve (FIV). The bridge plug was set in the screen joints of the well, allowing the swellable packer time to expand to the required diameter.</p><div id="link-7">
