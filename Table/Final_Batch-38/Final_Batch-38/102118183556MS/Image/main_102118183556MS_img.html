<p id="Ancr1">El-Morgan Field (Figure 01) was discovered by the drilling of the El-Tor-1 well in February, 1965. Two oil productive zones were found. Subsequently, these two zones were identified as the Belayim formation and Kareem formation (Figure 02). The drilling of second and third wells confirmed the commercial viability of the oil discovery. Production operation commenced on April 12, 1967. As of May 1, 1968 there were 17 producing wells in the field, and drilling operations were continuing.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The Kareem (Figure 04) is medium-coarse grained, poorly sorted arkosic sands inter-bedded with laminated shales. Normal grading is common, and individual sand bodies sometimes show coarse erosive bases, resulting in sand stacking and good vertical communication. Sands are sheet-like and no evidence is seen for channelization. The Kareem likely consists of a series of overlapping lobes that were strongly influenced by rift-bathymetry.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">High production rates from Kareem reservoir resulted in a rapid pressure decline (Figure 05) which caused a rapid increase in Gas-Oil Ratio (GOR) due to the high bubble-point pressure as well. This reservoir performance indicated that the underlying aquifer was not active enough to support production operations at high rates. As a result, GUPCO initiated evaluating the possibility of Water Injection in late 1970 to increase reservoir pressure and improve the production rate.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">From 1975 through 1990, many wells had been drilled in Kareem reservoir with high withdrawal rate which in turn needs higher pressure support. That's why in mid-1990, Waterflooding strategy is changed; Infill-injectors were started to be used in addition to the peripheral injectors. This strategy resulted in a better Waterflooding efficiency for both displacing and sweeping the oil. It is noteworthy that the infill injectors were placed carefully in a manner helping in minimizing the bypassed oil. Figure (06) shows the wells status during that period.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr16">For Example, a base line RST was performed on the subject well (Figure 07) and after one year, another RST was run to determine the new saturation distribution. The second RST showed that the water saturation increase in the middle part indicating a possible high permeable strike. A third RST was run after two years and showed the movement of the bottom aquifer compared to the high permeable strike. Eventually this time-lapse process of logging gave us a very good shape regarding the dynamic reservoir behavior and helped in taking the right decision on the right time.</p><div id="link-16">

Their average permeability (air permeability from core plugs) is 100-300 mD, 200-500 mD, 500-1500 mD, 500-1000 mD respectively. That discrepancy in zones' permeabilities led to obvious vertical heterogeneity across Nubia zones.</p><div id="link-49">

<p id="Ancr50">After fifteen years of production, Nubia pressure hovered around the bubble point pressure. That's why Waterflooding started in 1996 to support the high offtake from Nubia wells by injecting in three wells (Figure 21) at that time (H11, G9 and G14). One of these injectors was dedicated to M2 zone only (G14) however the other two injectors were injecting in entire Nubia zones simultaneously.</p><div id="link-50">
