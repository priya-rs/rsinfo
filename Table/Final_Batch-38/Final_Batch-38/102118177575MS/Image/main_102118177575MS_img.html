The reservoir dipping is less than one degree at the crestal area and gently dips towards the flank. The reservoir is characterized by three sub zones, with eight layers, separated by two main stalyiolites (Fig. 2). Subzone I is very tight, however Subzone II has the best reservoir quality;Subzone III has good porosity, but low permeability and water bearing. Subzone I consists mainly of mudstone and wackestone (very tight interval).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The geological model with multimillion cells was constructed based on the available static data from more than 45 wells drilled and logged through the said reservoir as well as 11 cored wells. Maximum fine layering was applied to ensure proper modeling of the reservoir rock heterogeneity. The J-function technique was honored to initialize the model saturation profiles. Following initialization of the static model, the layering was up-scaled to the optimum number of layers for the dynamic model studies and initialization was honored as well (Fig. 3). This model was exported for the dynamic model with dynamic data update as discussed hereafter.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">MDT pressures and samples identification technique were conducted for 17 wells. The gathered information from the MDT helped better understanding of the gas &amp; oil distribution and the fluid contacts. One reservoir oil samples from the oil and six gas samples from the gas cap were collected for PVT studies that helped to build the most likely fluid model based on the experienced lateral and vertical composition variation across the reservoir (Fig. 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">The possibility of compartmentalization in our reservoir arises from several characteristics such as the lateral change in reservoir rock properties, presence of large faults, lateral variation in wells production, and mainly due to the abrupt changes in the GOC and OWC/ FWL. One challenge that is embedded with this concept is building its simulation model. During simulation model initialization stage and to be able to relate the differing FWL to the geological model, the FWL inferred from the saturation matching needed to be compared to the FWL inferred from MDT data, the GOR, and water cut data from the tested intervals (Fig.8)</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">The selected bottom hole locations for the first phase of development (Fig. 10) are selected in the areas where the best rock properties are identified. Selection of the new bottom hole locations was based on drilling from main land as well as the available natural and existing islands for cost reduction that directly impact the NPV of this challenge high productive reservoir[A1]. The development strategy calls to complete all the producers and injectors with highly slanted cased hole crossing all the layers of the oil, thus intercepting all the possible high permeable streaks and optimizing the perforation intervals at the lower part of the high permeable streaks, maximizing oil production and minimizing the gas cusping as well as high water production from the bottom aquifer.</p><div id="link-10">
