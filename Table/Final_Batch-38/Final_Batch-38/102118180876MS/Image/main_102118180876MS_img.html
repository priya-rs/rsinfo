<p id="Ancr3">There are only four commercial dry steam geothermal fields at present. These are the Geysers in California; the Larderello in central Italy; the Matsukawa in Japan; and the Kawah Kamojang in western Java, Indonesia (Aapg, 2016). Vapor-dominated sites offer temperatures from 240 to 300 °C that produce superheated steam. Liquid-dominated reservoirs (LDRs) are found near young volcanoes and in rift zones and hot spots. Typical example of this is the Bouillante geothermal field, Guadeloupe. Fig 1 shows a schematic of a typical geothermal system.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">This enhanced geothermal system (EGS) generates geothermal fluid without the need for natural hot fluid resources. This concept is illustrated in Fig. 2 and is similar to steam injection system used in the oil and gas sector where steam is injected into the reservoir via the injection well and the production well produces the hydrocarbon to surface. In the EGS system however water is injected via the injection well and steam and hot water is produced through the production well.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Fig 3 shows some of the main benefits of geothermal energy. One of the potential benefits is lower cost electricity. Fig. 4 shows the 2015 electricity prices in the potential geothermal islands. The prices range from US eighteen (18) cents to fifty three (53) cents per KWh which is significantly greater than the subsidized prices of three (3) cents in Trinidad. The potential electricity prices from geothermal development ranges can be in the range of five (5) to ten (10) cents per KWh.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The reason for the existence of these thermal features is the westward subduction of the North Atlantic crustal plate beneath the Caribbean plate (Huttrer and LaFleur, 2015). There are nine English-speaking islands in the Eastern Caribbean region that have potential for the discovery of geothermal resources capable of economically feasible power generation (Figure 5). From north to south, they are: Saba, St. Eustatius, St. Kitts &amp; Nevis, Montserrat, Dominica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, and Grenada.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The reason for the active volcanism in that the Caribbean islands results from the subduction of the westward moving North American plate beneath the eastern margin of the Caribbean Plate (Figure 6). Accordingly, volcanic arcs typical of plate boundaries have formed over time and, in the Caribbean, each volcano or group of volcanoes forms the foundation of a discrete island. The active subduction zone formed from the oceanic lithosphere of the Atlantic Ocean subducting under the thicker Caribbean Plate give rise to these discrete islands that start as far North as Saba and stretch to Grenada in the South.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The table indicates that there were nine (9) wells drilled in St Lucia exploring for geothermal reservoirs. Fig 7 shows a snapshot of the location of these wells in relation to each other, the depth drilled and four potential geothermal wells (Wells 4, 5, 6 and SL2) penetrated reservoir temperatures in the range 201–261 degrees Celsius. The SL–2 well have been on test producing between 9–17.5 kg/s of hydrothermal fluids.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">The potential development for geothermal energy in the Caribbean is illustrated in Fig 9. The graph shows the installed electricity capacity, potential geothermal capacity in 5 years and potential geothermal capacity in 10 years. The graph shows that 5 islands (St Lucia, Dominica, Guadeloupe, Montserrat and Nevis) have potential geothermal development within the next 5 years. These potential geothermal capacities have been estimated from exploration works carried out in these islands. Some of which are highlighted in Table 2 above.</p><div id="link-9">
