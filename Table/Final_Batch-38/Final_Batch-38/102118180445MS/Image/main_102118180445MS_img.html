<p id="Ancr1">Geochemical techniques can be used to quantitatively determine the contribution of each of several zones to a commingled oil (or gas) stream (after McCaffrey et al. 2011). The present study describes one particularly useful application of this technique to multilateral wells: identification of sanded-out intervals for FCO. This study shows three examples where this technique was applied in the West Sak field on the North Slope of Alaska (Fig. 1),</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">West Sak is a biodegraded oil accumulation reservoired between 2,400 and 3,800 ft subsea in cool (75°F) Upper Cretaceous marine sandstones of the Schrader Bluff Formation (Werner 1987). Production is primarily from the West Sak D, B and A sands. A type log is provided as Fig. 2 for illustration of the geologic complexity. The reservoirs consist of very fine-grained, poorly consolidated sand with permeabilities varying from 20 to 3000 md.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Well X is a trilateral well (mainbore plus two laterals, see Fig. 4) completed in the A, B, and D sands of the West Sak field. Total oil production from Well X fell in October 2012. Geochemical allocation of commingled production from that well indicated that the contribution of the B sand fell with overall production rate.</p><div id="link-4">
