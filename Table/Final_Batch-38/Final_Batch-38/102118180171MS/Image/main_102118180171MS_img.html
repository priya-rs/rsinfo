<p id="Ancr4">The reservoir is undersaturated in equilibrium conditions with initial reservoir pressure of 4,533 psia and saturation pressure of 4,500 psia. For the period of history, the Sam Hill oil field (the hypothetical oil field in consideration) consists of five producers and injectors with 2 years of history. The average water cut of the field is ~0% and average initial gas-oil ratio (GOR) of the field is ~230 v/v. The field is typically characterized by low water cut, low GOR, and high oil production rates, as shown in Fig. 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">For well SH-2, the local grid must be refined to reduce numerical dispersion and match the gas movement more accurately. Porosity around this well seems to be overestimated by the geologist; hence, a pore volume multiplier of 0.7 was used to reduce the pore volume around the well. There could be some gas measurement issue because pressure and liquid production rate matched well locally. Fig. 5 shows the stimulated versus observed data for SH-2.</p><div id="link-5">

It is the sum of the discounted net cash flow of each period over the life of the project.

It is useful because it helps the reservoir engineer to plan for future improved recovery or an enhanced recovery scheme. A plot of cumulative before-tax cash flow (BTCF) was plotted against the forecast timeline. The point where the cumulative BTCF starts to decline is the point where the economic limit is reached, and further decision and analysis must be carried out to ensure maximum hydrocarbon recovery is achieved.

<p id="Ancr26">Once the development scenario has been decided, an economic sensitivity analysis on the after taxed cash flow was carried out. In this project, sensitivity variables included operational costs such as injection water, produced water treatment, and other operating expenditures are subject to change of up to 50%. The same applies to production variables such as oil and gas price. The final decision will be based on NPV, recovery factor, economic limit, and after-tax cash-flow sensitivity. Figs. 22–24 show some of the sensitivity analyses for the scenarios.</p><div id="link-24">
