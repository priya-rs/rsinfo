<p id="Ancr1">Oil will play an increasingly important role in the Asia Pacific's energy supply, partly due to the rapid adoption of road vehicles in the developing countries (IEA 2017b). China accounts for nearly half of the region's oil production, but the country's oil production peaked in 2015. Other major producers in the region have seen flat to declining production since 2010 with the exception of Thailand which has seen modest but steady growth (Figure 1). Total oil production in the Asia Pacific region is approximately 8.7% of the world's production in an area representing more than 35% of the world's oil consumption. Asia Pacific oil reserves represent only about 3% of the world's total in an area with more than 50% of the world's population (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

Drilling activity in the region remains depressed compared to most international regions (Figure 3). Only Latin America had a more pronounced decrease in drilling activity than did Asia Pacific. Asia Pacific drilling has increasingly focused on natural gas projects. The region represents about 10% of global gas reserves (Figure 2). China and Japan lead the region in gas consumption with strong gas growth in India, South Korea and Australia.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">Given the many sources and destinations for crude oil, it was necessary to generalize oil transport distance. For most cases, we assumed Shanghai as the port of final destination, with the exception to this rule being India which exports no significant volumes of oil. Transportation for Indian oil was assumed to be internal pipelines. A summary of CI values is presented in Figure 7 with colors representing the sources of carbon emissions. Offsite emmissions may be negative when produced gas is exported and utilized.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Unconventional production in the US has grown at an astounding rate (Figure 8). Figure 9 compares carbon intensity of US unconventional oils with Asia Pacific oils. The lowest CI values come primarily from four Middle Eastern exporters and have CI values that are very low by global standards. The best AP regional producers have CI values that are still good by global standards. The average US CI value is calculated using major US unconventional crudes and assuming the export to Shanghai. The three example unconventional crudes are from a prior publication (Meehan et al. 2018) and only have transportation to the US Gulf Coast.</p><div id="link-8">
