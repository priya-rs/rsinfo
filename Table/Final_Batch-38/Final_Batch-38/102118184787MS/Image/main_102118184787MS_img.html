<p id="Ancr4">The well was designed to intersect all three producing formations and to test them separately with an option to develop all three simultaneously. Several options of MSF completion assemblies were considered, but re-closable premium frac ports with openhole, hydraulically activated packers were selected for this project because the option to selectively pump hydraulic fracture treatments and access and test the formations was considered of vital importance (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Fig. 3 shows the hydraulic shifting tool bottomhole assembly. The tool activates by pumping fluid at a predetermined rate, which triggers the extendable lathes (phased 120 deg). The bottomhole assembly is then picked up (to shift open) or lowered down (to shift closed) to engage the valve sleeve.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Then the pumping rate was reduced to collapse the latches, the tool was run below the valve, followed by increasing the pumping rate to again expand the latches, and finally picking up the CT. Attempts were made several times to verify that the sleeve was shifted to the desired position. As shown in Fig. 4, during one run, it is possible to manage a few valves, depending on the requirement. An injectivity test was then performed to verify the port was open, or a pressure integrity test if all the valves were closed. The fluid level in the return tank was used as an additional indicator. For instance, when the port was shifted open, the fluid level and return flow rate would drop.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The inhibitor was used at 20% concentration during the flush stage to avoid hydrates in the wellbore during well cleanout and kickoff operations. Before the main treatment, a calibration stage was pumped into Khamakinskiy formation. It indicated fluid efficiency would be lower than expected and net pressure higher. Therefore, the schedule for the main treatment was modified to increase the maximum proppant concentration up to 1200 KgPA and increase the pad volume. (Fig. 5 shows ports location, execution plots and resulting fracture geometry).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">To overcome these challenges, a new CT system has been developed for real-time production logging and conventional applications (Fig. 6a). The system consists of a fiber optic control line (outside diameter 1.8 mm) inside the coiled tubing to transmit data from downhole tools to surface equipment and interpretation software. Standard measurements provided by this system include pressure inside and outside the bottomhole assembly, temperature in the wellbore, casing collar locator and gamma ray signals, allowing for real-time depth correlation, as well as distributed temperature survey, or DTS (Burdin, et al. 2016).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">Fig. 7 confirms that the lowermost Talakhskiy (Port 1) is suppressed by the hydrostatic fluid column above it. The vertical difference between Port 2 and Port 3 is only 7 m, but the fluid head is enough to suppress the flow from the lower port since the Khamakinskiy formation gives a high rate at a minimum drawdown. Attempts to increase the drawdown (i.e., reduce bottomhole pressure to enable flow from Port 3) will inevitably lead to hydrate formation and wellbore blockage.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">The premium-port completion that was installed is a combined liner, with the upper section of the liner to be cemented. The cementing landing nipple and ball were drilled out by the rig. During the initial coiled tubing runs, the pipe experienced difficulties passing through that area. A milling operation was performed, followed by a junk basket toolstring. After retrieving the junk basket at surface, pieces of ball, cementing landing nipple, and residual cement were found as shown on Fig. 8.</p><div id="link-8">
