<p id="Ancr1">The Goodwyn gas-condensate field was discovered in 1971 by the Goodwyn-1 exploration well, which penetrated a 116m gross hydrocarbon column in the Triassic Mungaroo Formation (Figure 1 and Figure 2). This discovery well was followed by eight further exploration and appraisal wells (Goodwyn-2 to Goodwyn-9) drilled between 1971 and 1986. Following field appraisal, nineteen development wells were drilled from the Goodwyn Alpha (GWA) platform (GWA01 to GWA19) developing the GE, GFA and GG reservoirs.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Tidepole's reservoirs consist of marginal marine and fluvial sands within a series of antithetic fault blocks to the east of the main NNE-SSW bounding fault, Figure 3. All the Tidepole exploration and appraisal wells intersected gas in multi-Darcy Mungaroo reservoir sands and all, except Tidepole East-1, found gas in high-quality Brigadier Formation reservoirs sub-cropping under the Jurassic Oxfordian Main Unconformity (JOMU).</p><div id="link-3">

A wireless gauge was installed in the V10 sand. The wireless gauge batteries in this well had also expired prior to field start up and no data was recoverable. Figure 4 illustrates the actual well configuration.</p><div id="link-4">

Each well has been completed with a dual zone smart completion with expandable screens (ESS) for sand control (Figure 6).

The production fluid flow pathways per zone are much the same for Goodwyn GH(A/B) and Tidepole wells, but the completed interval design varies by well and field due to reservoir architecture and the selected sand control method (ESS or CHGP).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">At the start of production, at initial reservoir conditions, limiting gas volumetric flow rates were calculated for each zone based on the permeability distribution of the completed interval, its reservoir pressure and temperature and the fluid PVT properties. This limiting gas volumetric rate declines as reservoir pressure declines, Figure 8, and so these zonal limits are recalculated on a regular basis using the results of PBUs and MRTs.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">Figure 9 illustrates how the well mass flow rate operating limit is calculated from PBU and MRT data. The analysis relies on the observations that each well has a common datum point for tubing pressure measurement at the commingling point and that each completion's response upstream of the commingling point is independent. For each zone, the limiting gas volumetric flow rate may be calculated based on the PBU-derived reservoir pressure and the gas formation volume factor at prevailing conditions.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">Figure 10 presents an example of P/Z analysis from two zones in a single well, made possible through the smart well configuration. The data underlying this analysis (accurate zonal pressure and accurate zonal production) would not have been available for a commingled conventional well. Recognizing the inherent inaccuracy of both pressure and cumulative production data, it has been found useful to plot observed response overlaid on the ideal depletion-drive response of the mapped, connected volumetric range, rather than performing a deterministic analysis of the observed data only.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">Following some months of steady production and pressure decline consistent with the expected in-place volume in the completed V3 sand interval, well GDA01 in the Goodwyn GH(A/B) reservoir units exhibited an anomalous reservoir pressure increase, Figure 4 and Figure 11. Subsequent performance showed that the level of pressure support to the well had increased and investigations followed into potential mechanisms and sources of pressure support.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">In order to test one hypothesis, that pressure support to the V3 in GDA01 comes from the overlying V5 sand, the V5 completion in GDA02 was shut-in using its ICV whilst production from GDA01 V3 was continued. This configuration allowed production from well GDA02 to continue from its lower zone only, reducing production deferment. Pressure data from the V5 interval in GDA02, pink line Figure 12, suggests continuous pressure build-up in V5 zone while V3 is produced in GDA01 well, black line Figure 12. This confirmed no communication between zones, eliminating the V5 as the source of V3 pressure support.</p><div id="link-12">
