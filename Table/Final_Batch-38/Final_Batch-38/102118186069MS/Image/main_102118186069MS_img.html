<p id="Ancr2">The neurons are connected forming a network with respective synaptic weight for each neuron. ANN is considered as nonlinear statistical data modeling tools where the nonlinear relationship between inputs and outputs are modeled. Using hidden layers, which consist of a number of layers of neurons, the collection of neurons can model higher order functions based on the basic function of each neuron. See Figure 1 for an illustration (reproduced based on Guerillot and Bruyelle, 2017). The first layer consists of input neurons, which send information to the second layers. The second layer then send the output (after some calculations) to the next layers.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The geological aspect of the targeted reservoir is given as follows. The reservoir was deposited in a transition environment, which ranges from upper delta plain to pro-delta and further to disal shallow marine. As a result, the reservoir is dominated by channel sands with considerable heterogeneity. This sandstone reservoir exhibits an anticline structure with two crests located in the north part and south part, respectively. The long axis in the north part directs from N to S. The long axis in the south part directs from N-NW to S-SE. Figure 2 shows the depth contour map of this reservoir.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">It is believed mainly because of the fluctuation of relative sea level such that there is significant variations of the spatial distribution and scale of sand bodies according to the evolution of depositional facies. We use core, thin sections and well logs to perform detailed sequence stratigraphic study. It is revealed that the target reservoir is composited by two third order sequence. We further divided it into six members and fifteen zones according to the higher level depositional cycles and its lithofacies associations. See Figure 3 for the sandbody distribution of the sandstone reservoir.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Based on certain selection criteria as discussed in Wei et al (2016), four water flooding pilots have been suggested. In Figure 4, we show the locations of the four pilot projects in the structure map. Focusing on Pilot I, we further provide the stratigraphy section for Pilot I in Figure 5. As shown in Figure 5, the thickness of member 2 to 4 ranges from 6 to 8 m. The thickness of member 5 exceeds 10 m. The average permeability of member 2 to 6 is 74 mD. In comparison with other areas of the reservoir, this area represents the medium quality of the reservoir. We further use this pilot in our following studies.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">We first perform history match using production history data to calibrate the sector model. The global optimizer CMA-ES is applied minimize the objective function. CMA-ES show very good convergence performance in terms of iteration number to find the global minimum. In the history matching workflow, we apply optimal ANN as the proxy, which significantly reduces the computational time. The combination of optimal ANN and CMA-ES is shown to be very effective for history matching. In Figure 8 and Figure 9 we show an example of the history match results of the measure well pressures and liquid rates.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">It is apparent that uncertainty in reservoir parameters lead to uncertainty in the objective function. In the optimization process, control variables are optimized by evaluating the objective function. Thus, when we have uncertainty in the objective function, our aim is therefore to find a choice of parameters that optimizes a selection of objective functions rather than looking for an optimum each individual scenario. Using the approach, we optimize the water flooding pilot and obtain the optimum control variables under uncertainty. It is shown that CMA-ES works very well together with the optimal ANN. In Figure 10 we plot the convergence history. It can been seen that we find a global minimum at around 200 iterations. The success of this workflow is believed to be attributed to the optimal ANN. We further show the validation cross plot of the trained ANN in Figure 11. It can been seen the training data is very well correlated to the validation data.</p><div id="link-10">
