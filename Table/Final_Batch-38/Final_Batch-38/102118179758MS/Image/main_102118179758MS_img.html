The three injectors confine two horizontal producers to the pilot, with two other horizontal producers placed at the boundary of the trial (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The trial has three observation wells to determine horizontal and vertical sweep in the pilot area and, also the polymer losses. The model is built around the pilot and has a total of six producers, three injectors and three observation wells (Figure 1).

Figure 5 shows our primitive workflow steps that is used initially, which yields 73 runs for the 10 variability models.

<p id="Ancr9">RMSE is used as the first HM quality indicator or screening criterion. An example is provided in Figure 6 that shows the BSW match of one of the most difficult wells for a set of screened HM realizations output from this DoE iteration. For all the analyses in this study, oil rate, cumulative oil, cumulative water and BSW at different points of time for each well are taken as the observables (including BHP for injectors). The star marks in the plot indicate the observables for the calculation of HM error (RMSE). The band around each observable denotes the tolerance for acceptable HM response.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr22">Figure 19 shows the match obtained from the new model to polymer flood response in the three pilot injectors. Having obtained a geological realization to explain the injectors response, there could also be other possibilities of, for instance, near wellbore phenomena like plugging that might contribute to such pressure response in the injectors11. Further studies are being undertaken to investigate this subject.</p><div id="link-21">
