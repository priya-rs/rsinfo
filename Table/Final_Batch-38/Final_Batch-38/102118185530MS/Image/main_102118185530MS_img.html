<p id="Ancr5">Vizcacheras is a mature oil field producing from two fluvial sandstone formations, Barrancas and Papagayos (Fig.2a). The object of the study is the Papagayos formation that has been exploited since 1965. The field was initially developed with a 600 m well spacing. Subsequently central areas were infilled resulting in a 300 m spacing.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">In the production history of Papagayos Fm., we see a rapid increment of water production in the early years (since 1968) due to aquifer inflow during the reservoir exploitation (Fig.3a). Currently, wells produce with 98% water cut. In addition, in the pressure history of Papagayos Fm.; we observe a gradual and slow decline in pressure over three decades due to the aquifer support (Fig.3b). The pressure reduced from 154 bar originally to the present pressure of 100 bar.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">Initially, we used the extensive history production data set and the static pressure measurements (RFTs) to constrain the history matching. The key matching parameters were the curvature of relative permeability curves, faults transmissibility and sands continuity in the northwest of the reservoir. We constrained simulation runs by liquid rate control and varied match parameters until global oil and water rates were simultaneously matched (Fig. 5). Once field rates were matched within an acceptable tolerance, we focused on the pressure match of individual wells with respect to RFT data.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">Fig. 8, shows that in 2000 there was an increase in pressure that cannot be explained through the small recorded volume of injected water into the formation. At the same time as the pressure in Papagayos reservoir was seen to increase, large volumes of disposal water were started to be injected into the base of the Barrancas Fm., a high permeability, non-hydrocarbon bearing interval. This led to a hypothesis of pressure communication with the underlying reservoir.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr13">As mentioned previously, we first matched RFT data. In the tracks of Fig. 10, we see simultaneously the simulated pressures and RFT data as yellow circles. It is observed that wells closer to the west, commonly known as Vizcacheras-West (Vizcacheras West, what is assumed to be an isolated accumulation), have a lower pressure. This is thought to be because the aquifer has less impact on this sector since it lies further away from the OWC and water needs to pass through a more tortuous pathway to reach this zone.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">Additionally, the model was used to simulate changes in water saturation through time. Fig. 11 shows simulated water saturation in a dip section of the full field model for different dates. We see that due to the high vertical permeability in the reservoir, gravitational forces dominate over the viscous forces, thus resulting in water under ride. Therefore, the aquifer swept the lower sand, leaving oil at the top, the aforementioned attic oil. This supports the hypothesis that the remaining oil is trapped hydrodynamically.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr20">To represent the augmenting of the aquifer that we are proposing, we doubled the injection rate to see if we can sweep the attic oil. Fig. 17, shows three consecutive pictures, two hours apart, of the oil saturation in the cell. Between figures 1 and 2, at a 98% water cut, the difference in the oil profile is almost imperceptible. In figure 3 there is a significant thinning of the attic oil and hence a change in the oil saturation as a result of increasing the water injection rate.</p><div id="link-17">
