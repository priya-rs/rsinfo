<p id="Ancr2">The Petroleum Company of Trinidad and Tobago is the national oil company with an exploration and production licence to operate the Soldado Fields, its marine asset. This marine asset is managed by Petrotrin Trinmar Operations. The Soldado Fields are is located in the Gulf of Paria, off the south-western peninsula of Trinidad &amp; Tobago, and comprise six fields: Main Soldado, North Soldado, East Soldado, South-West Soldado, West Soldado and Jubilee (Fig-2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">This major obstacle, coupled with repeat workovers (Fig-3 &amp; Fig-4) and unsuccessful completion of heavy workovers (Fig-5) drove the initiative to revise the approach to the company’s well intervention campaigns. Heavy workover candidates were no longer economic to execute and the repeat workovers were quickly increasing the cost of well interventions (Fig-6). Field management meetings with a cross-functional team were re-introduced to identify quick-win initiatives for the wells requiring low-cost investments while the detailed field reviews continued to create a group of wells for reactivation when oil prices allow for economic workovers.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The first approach was an evaluation of low-cost activities to reactivate wells. This quick-wins method included low cost rig-less interventions such as coiled tubing clean out (CTCO) campaigns. The CTCO activities showed an increase over the years with a marked increase in 2014 (Fig-7) and a success rate of 85%.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Though the methodology is not entirely new to Petrotrin (Figs - 8 &amp; 9), it was not aggressively implemented but was applied to the well review process to allow Petrotrin to be better prepared for more favourable oil prices. The previous models omitted the post well analysis subsequent to the well intervention hence the proposal of a more comprehensive model.</p><div id="link-8">
