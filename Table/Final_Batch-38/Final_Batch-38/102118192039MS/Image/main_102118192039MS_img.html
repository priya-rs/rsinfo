The area highlighted in yellow in Fig. 3 has enough permeability to flow naturally from matrix, thus an enhancement or remediation is usually performed for the purpose of a damage removal by matrix acidizing. Other areas correspond to low permeability reservoirs which typically require hydraulic fracturing.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">Fig. 5 illustrates the workflow. Once the resevoir model is calibrated with production history in static and dynamic modeling, geomechanical modeling was conducted to create a 3D MEM (Mechanical Earth Model) to provide stress field information for wellbore stability analysis and hydraulic fracturing simulation. The 3D MEM was calibrated with a 1D MEM of the pilot-hole, which was constructed from log-based geomechanical data and tied to a set of laboratory rock mechanics tests, wellbore images and drilling events. The calibrated stress field is utilized in our stimulation and completion screening study afterwards.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr13">Multiple realizations formed by each MPS scienario were screened with history matching of the past production data of the Kita-Akita field (Fig. 8) and the single realization was chosen for the each MPS model (Figs 6&amp;7). The SIS model exhibits highly discontinuous distribution (Fig. 6A, right). As a result, a higher reservoir Net-to-Gross ratio was needed to match the historical production data, relative to the actual well data. Therefore, the SIS model was considered to be inconsistent. The history-matched realizations from the two MPS cases demonstrated distinctive reservoir distributions. The channel and the sheet models from the MPS show vertically and laterally connected distributions, respectively (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-8">

Based on previous studies mapping the stress field at a regional scale, the long side of the model aligned with the direction of maximum tectonic strain. The direction is approximately N135°E. From outcrop analogs and initial 1D geomechanics modeling results, fracture height containment was a concern from the apparent lack of vertical stress barriers.</p><div id="link-9">

All sandstone connected zone of the created infill wells are then perforated and reservoir simulation was performed.

<p id="Ancr22">Fig. 17 shows the mud weight window in the reservoir section for wells to NE-SW (left) and NW-SE (right) directions. Here, the lower limit of the window is the higher value between pore pressure and mud weight to prevent any borehole breakout to minimize the risk due to wellbore instability from drilling a well to landing completion assembly. As shown in the figure, the mud weight window of a well along the NE-SW direction is narrower than one of a well along the NW-SE direction. Since there are some sporadic intervals in which more than 1.2 SG mud weight is required as the lower limit, the mud weight window in the NE-SW direction is narrower, with range from 1.37 to 1.47 SG.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr35">Fig. 30 shows a simulated ten years cumulative production of each openhole well with and without fishbone modeling, where each profile was normalized based on the openhole horizontal well. Same reservoir properties and simulation setting as calibrated in history-matched model was used. As seen in the figure, channel reservoir case highlights the highly deviated well which intends to penetrate all sand layers had 20 % increase in cumulative production compared to the horizontal well which intends to penetrate most good layer only.</p><div id="link-30">

<p id="Ancr36">Using that information, we firstly looked back the past treated hydraulic fracturing job in created 1D MEM based on goemchanical properties taken by the pilot-hole program. Fig. 31 illustrates fracture propagation result after closure. Since the job size in 1960s were much smaller proppant volume than today (Table 4), dimensionless conductivity was calculated almost zero. It is expected that a larger volume fracturing jobs would enhance well performance under the current sitation.</p><div id="link-31">

<p id="Ancr37">For a sand, dehaydration impact is larger due to higher permeability thus fracture tip (approximately 0.5 inch) become dry zone. In this area, fracuturing polymer is clogged and the pressure is not propagated. For a shale, due to lower permeability, fluid loss is small enough, thereore, dehydration zone is smaller (0.1 to 0.2 inch). In our sensitivity trial in 1D MEM, increasing the fracture toughness results in less fracture length and higher fracture height as shown in Fig 32.</p><div id="link-32">

<p id="Ancr38">Another unique setting in this reservoir is that 3D MEM initialization was performed after the reservoir pressure depleted from past producers, which may cause depletion induced stress in the reservoir as shown in Fig. 33. It may contribute to build enough barriers to contain a hydraulic fracture propagation. The result of the 3D MEM initialization, however, Shmin change was confirmed only 10 to 15 bar. Therefore, enough barrier was not generated from the depletion effect, therefore height growth issue should be considered for a fracturing design.</p><div id="link-33">

<p id="Ancr39">As seen in Fig. 34, the propped height is more contained in the same layer depth in 1D MEM when compared to the same fracture simulation running on the 3D MEM. This is because the vertical stress stays the same at any horizontal location. The simulations also suggest opposite fracture extention directions between these two models. In the 3D MEM case, higher stress zones exist down dip of fracture, and this works as a barrier of the fracture propagation in that direction.</p><div id="link-34">
