<p id="Ancr7">Since gas reservoir volume factors (3.0 RB/MSCF for CO2, 3.6 RB/MSCF for recycle gas) are high at the low Yates (640 psi in 2004) reservoir pressure, these increases in gas injection had a much larger effect on the reservoir processing rate at Yates than they would in the deeper, higher pressure reservoirs where CO2 has been injected elsewhere in the Permian Basin. Figure 5 shows how the reservoir production and injection rates increased from around 500,000 to 1,800,000 RBPD with the 2nd Phase of CO2 injection beginning in 2004. However, the oil cut as a percentage of the reservoir fluid production continued on its same hyperbolic decline, indicating that the production increase was not due to a miscible process.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr22">When this entire 1000 feet (21 grid blocks) of completion was opened in the model, total fluid production was far too high. Reducing the number of open grid blocks to 6 (every 4th block being open) resulted in a more representative total fluid rate. The GOR was too low and WOR too high, so the well was completed two layers shallower in the model, resulting in the history match shown in Figure 20. The oil-water contact appears to be lower in this part of the model area. An improved reservoir description should improve this match quality.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr24">The YFU 4045 HCM Pilot produced incremental tertiary oil. By history matching the reservoir performance the model can be used to explain how the Y-Grade is processed in the reservoir. Figure 22 illustrates how the model predicts the Y-Grade has swept the reservoir through the beginning of 2018. The global mole fraction of ethane, a major component of Y-Grade, is used as a proxy for the Y-Grade concentration.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr25">The model forecast oil production in Figure 21 is shown to exceed the historical oil rate during the initial Y-Grade injection period from November 2016 to July 2017. So for calculating the Y-Grade utilization, the incremental oil rate was reduced by a factor of 75 percent, as shown in Figure 23. Using the actual Pilot Y-Grade injection volume, the 75 percent adjusted incremental oil rate forecast, and the Y-Grade recovery forecast shown in Figure 17, the estimated gross and net YFU 4045 HCM Pilot Y-Grade utilizations are those calculated in Table 2.</p><div id="link-23">
