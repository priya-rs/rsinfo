<p id="Ancr15">A summary on increasing capillary number to reduce residual fluid saturation is presented in Figure 1. This summary is resumed from various phenomena of fluid flow in porous media, which covers oil, microemulsion and brine flow. Figure 1 portrays the attempt to recover more fluid either oil or brine is achievable by increasing trapping number NT. The contribution of trapping number can be approached either by capillary number side or Bond number side. Bond number covers the density difference Δγ, fluid bubble size d and both wettability θ and surface tension Ts. </p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr16">Figure 2a tells that Klamono Field is located in the East part of Salawati Basin. The reservoir consists of three formations, which are Kais, Sirga and Klasefet Formation under strong water drive force. The New Guinea Limestone Group encompassed of Oligocene to Miocene aged Faumai, Sirga, Kais and Klasafet formations are the key in tertiary strata (See Figure 2b). The major reservoir is Kais carbonates while the source of hydrocarbon is Klasafet shale (Satyana et al, 1999). General reservoir properties are displayed in Table 2. The reason of EDH application is due to its API at 18.5 and viscosity 68 cP (at 52 °C). A crude is categorised as a heavy oil if its API is between 10 to 22 (Pramana et al., 2012).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr17">The primary candidate for our trial of EDH is well KLO-X1 (See Figure 3). KLO-X1 was drilled on 6 Aug 2007 at 141 m TVD. It could be categorized as a shallow oil well. It is assisted by Sucker Rod Pump. Due to low influx, the well is suspended for a while. The well has been producing since 15 May 2009 at 289 blpd and 5.8 bopd (98% water cut) after respacing job (change of rod spacing at SRP). Current well oil cumulative is approximately 1085 STB (See Figure 3a). Reparation job has been done 4 times those are Feb 2008, Aug 2009, Sept 2011 and Nov 2013.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr18">As mentioned in the Introduction section, viscosity is critical to the fluid flow of oil. Experimental data is achieved from Fann VG measurement and a set of fitting equations is employed to see how dead oil behaves under a wider temperature range. Possible temperature range must follow what reservoir condition is like and the density is, in fact, pressure dependent (See Figure 3b). Dead oil equation is presented as Eq. 5 (McCain, 1990). Detailed parameters of equation set to compute oil density is presented in Appendices section. A macro tool has been provided to compute the equations set and density of dead oil properties (See Appendix 1 and Figure 4) (Guo, 2007). A rough trend of thermal gradient is projected from the top and bottom well temperature as follows 0.180833 °C/m.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr20">The analytical results have good agreement with the field data oil rate, with 0.8% and 2.3% relative error with respect to the field data, pre- and post-EDH installation respectively. It gains 10 blpd rises after EDH was installed on the 2nd day after installation (See Figure 6). The comparison of field and prediction data as revealed in Figure 6 shows that prediction has a pessimistic trend. It might be due to higher volume exhibiting heat exchange via convection than it should be. The computation of temperature is carried out at the static condition of heat transfer along the tubing (gross pipe length Lpipe=109 m). According to Eq. 6 (also See Appendix 2), the volume considered is the entire liquid along inside the tubing.</p><div id="link-6">
