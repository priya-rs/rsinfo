<p id="Ancr6">Understanding the physical properties of CO2 is critical to evaluating CO2 floods and storage projects. The critical temperature and pressure of CO2 are 87.8°F (Tc, CO2) and 1,071 psia (pc, CO2), respectively (Fig. 1). A large number of existing mature oil reservoirs have temperatures (Tf) less than Tc, CO2. However, a corresponding vapor pressure (pvap, CO2) exists below which CO2 is a gas. When pf is greater than or equal to pvap, CO2, CO2 is a liquid.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">The estimated original oil in place (OOIP) of the Bald Unit is about 2.1 million standard barrels (stb). The unit was developed on 10-acre well spacing. The average daily oil production rate (Fig. 4) increased significantly in 1986, 1989, 1999, and 2003. Before 1986, relatively high backpressure was kept at the producing wells. In 1986, the pumping unit motors’ speed was increased to decrease backpressure and increase production.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">A miscible CO2 pilot, funded by the US Department of Energy, was implemented at Mumford Hills by combining the Bailey, Bailey-Alexander, Davis, and Davis-Lindsey (including Stedman, Alexander 1) leases (Fig. 5). The CO2 flood included seven wells, specifically four production wells, two reservoir monitoring wells, and one water-CO2 injection well. Three monitoring wells—MH1, MH2, and MH3 (Fig. 4)—were used to monitor pressure and gas composition to verify whether CO2 plume migration was influenced by the flow direction of the injected water (Frailey and Finley, 2010).</p><div id="link-5">

The injection pressure at BU-1 ranged between 1,100 psia and 1,600 psia, which is well above the vapor pressure of CO2 (Fig.6) and confirms CO2 is a liquid at the injector. Two of the four oil production wells’ bottom hole pressures were above and two were below the vapor pressure.</p><div id="link-6">

However, the net utilization of the pilot and field scenarios, ranged from 6–10 and 30-34 Mscf/stb, respectively. The pilots were much close aligned to that expected from Permian Basin CO2 floods (5–10 Mscf/stb), while the field scenarios were significantly higher because of additional storage into an underlying aquifer (Fig. 9).</p><div id="link-9">
