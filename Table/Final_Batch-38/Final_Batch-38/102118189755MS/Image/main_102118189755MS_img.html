<p id="Ancr2">Figure 1 shows the saturation vapor pressure of a number of alkanes that are the main constituents of aforementioned hydrocarbon solvent mixtures. As it can be seen from this figure, the vapor pressure of the solvents increases as the solvent become lighter. The operating temperature range of interest in Heated VAPEX process is70-150 °C in which the bitumen viscosity is reduced enough to provide an effective dispersive and diffusive mixing and therefore sufficiently high bitumen recovery rates.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Figure 2 shows the enthalpy of the hydrocarbon solvents. As it can be seen, the heat of vaporization of the solvents decreases as the temperature increases and approaches to the critical temperature. For the operating temperature range of interest in Heated VAPEX process, lighter hydrocarbons have the lowest heat of vaporization. This translates into a higher volumes of solvent in circulation (in cold liquid equivalent) or solvent-to-oil ratio (SolOR) in the Heated VAPEX process.</p><div id="link-2">

Use of lighter solvents can also result in loss of a significant recoverable bitumen volumes due to deposition of the heavy phase in the depleted reservoir. Figure 3 shows the second heavy liquid phase or asphaltene precipitation behavior of a typical Athabasca bitumen with different solvents at a solvent content of 70 wt% and two different temperatures.</p><div id="link-3">

As it was described in the previous section, the azeotropic systems for heavier solvents have a higher energy content in the injected azeotropic fluid compared to lighter solvents and therefore result in a higher reduction in SolOR as is shown in Table 1 and Figure 11 which compares the nC5 and nC7 solvents performance.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">The steam co-injection at azeotropic concentration and the related phase equilibrium changes in the Azeotropic Heated VAPEX process result in the PBRSR improvements compared to Heated VAPEX as shown in Figure 12. In the Heated VAPEX conditions, the vaporized in-situ water in the depleted zone is replaced with hydrocarbon liquid phase which is mainly the condensed liquid solvent. Inhibiting the in-situ water vaporization in the Azeotropic Heated VAPEX results in reduction in solvent condensation in the depleted chamber which is needed to provide the required energy for water vaporization.</p><div id="link-12">

The nC7 azeotropic vapor mixture has a lower azeotropic solvent concentration compared to nC5 azeotropic vapor mixture; hence, it has a lower vapor solvent storage in the chamber and a higher reduction in PBRSR.
