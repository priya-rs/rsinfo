To a large extent, these samples are crack free and are dominated by equant pores. This is consistent with the linear pressure behavior observed in the majority of porosity and permeability measurements. Composition varies, i.e. the Asmari samples have dolomitic crystallization within existing pores which affects density, porosity and permeability.</p><div id="link-6">
