<p id="Ancr3">The full range of screening criteria, and the processes they were applied to, are shown in Figure 1. As shown, each process had a different set of criteria applied to it depending on the nature of the process. For example, low salinity waterflooding (± polymer) and alkaline flooding were the only processes to have the acidity of the crude oil (as measured by Total Acid Number, TAN) as a screening criterion, as TAN influences the effectiveness of these processes (Taber and Martin, 1983; Law et al., 2014; Thyne, 2016) but has no influence on the other processes.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The criteria used are, for the most part, similar those that have been used in previous published EOR screening work (e.g. Taber et al., 1997; Aladasani and Bai, 2010; Dickson et al., 2010; Al-Bahar et al., 2004; McCormack et al., 2014). Some additional factors not used in these previous studies (or, at least not quantitatively) were net reservoir thickness, degree of fracturing, clay type (mineralogy), formation water salinity, proportion of initial oil remaining, and current (and previous) recovery process. Current recovery process may not have been relevant in previous studies in which the current process is always waterflood, but is relevant to the NCS where, as mentioned earlier, some types of EOR have already been implemented in some fields. The effect of the current process was evaluated using the matrix shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The degree to which the characteristics of a field reflect suitability for the application of a given recovery process is expressed as a screening score for each of the relevant screening criteria. In this study, scores were between 0 and 1, where zero means that the recovery process is not viable, and 1 means it is completely viable technically. The screening scores were assigned by defining four threshold values for each relevant criterion for each recovery process (Fig. 3). Minimum and Maximum (abbreviated to Min and Max) is the criterion range which is optimal for the recovery process, attracting a screening score of 1.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Secondly, the screening scores and their weights for each criterion are multiplied, and the products summed. The sum is then rescaled to give a dynamic range of 0 to 1, taking into account the variable minimum screening scores for some criteria (Fig. 3). The resulting overall screening suitability scores, and the individual screening scores from which they are calculated, are shown in a dashboard (Fig. 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Of the major oil fields on the NCS, 53 reservoirs from 27 oil fields were selected for inclusion in the study. The field operators kindly completed datasheets containing reservoir information upon which the screening study was performed. The studied fields, and an indication of their produced and remaining oil volumes, is shown in Figure 5. The vast majority of the remaining oil reserves involve production from waterflooding, with ~10% involving some degree of gas injection. Any application of EOR is thus mainly going to derive from the remaining resources volumes in Figure 5, and help create new reserve volumes.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The most conservative estimate of technical potential incremental volumes is to consider only the single process that gives the best EOR increment at the field level. For fields with multiple reservoirs, this may mean that the selected EOR process is sub-optimal in some reservoirs, but the logic is that operationally it would be simpler to apply only one process per field, and so this scenario would have a higher chance of being implemented. On this basis the overall technical potential volumes for the NCS are shown in Figure 6, broken out by recovery process.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The mid case technical potential incremental volume is 592 MSm3 (~3.7 billion barrels) across all 27 fields, the equivalent of adding 7% to their total recovery, taking average recovery factor from 47% to 54% (Fig. 7). The uncertainty range around this, as judged from the spread of the low and high input cases (Table 1;Fig. 6), is 320-860 MSm3 (2.0-5.4 billion barrels). Note that this only considers uncertainty in the increment calculations and excludes the considerable (but very difficult to quantify) uncertainty in the ability to obtain sanction to implement EOR in each field.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">Another view of the potential of each EOR process is simply to sum the increments calculated for each process in each reservoir (Fig. 8). Clearly the total incremental volume is meaningless, as most of these processes are alternatives that cannot be implemented together. Nevertheless, this view provides an unfiltered view of the technical potential of each EOR process without considering any operational issues. In this view, the various gas injection processes figure more prominently, with hydrocarbon miscible being the top process, CO2 miscible coming third, and immiscible hydrocarbon, CO2 and nitrogen showing significant potential.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">The functionality of the EOR screening toolkit allows the incremental volumes (and the low to high case uncertainty ranges) associated with individual opportunities to be evaluated using a variety of filters: for example, the top opportunities by volume per reservoir, field, region or overall; or the top individual opportunities to implement a specific EOR process. An example of this type of output is shown in Figure 9. This style of analysis allows promising individual opportunities to be identified to enable prioritization of research and development work, to focus dialogue between the NPD and the field operators, and to identify possible focus areas for field pilots.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">The EOR technical potential results were also analyzed geographically, to identify clusters of fields that could deploy the same process and thus benefit from economies of scale. This was done successfully on the UKCS, where clusters of fields with potential from low salinity waterflooding and miscible CO2 injection were identified, enabling the UK Oil and Gas Authority to encourage dialogue and potential cooperation between the relevant field operators (McCormack et al., 2014). The present study revealed similar clusters of fields on the NCS (Fig. 10).</p><div id="link-10">
