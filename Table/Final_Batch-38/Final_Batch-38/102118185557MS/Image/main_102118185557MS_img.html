<p id="Ancr2">Swarbrick and Osborne (1998) describe several mechanisms that originates abnormal pressures, which must be taken into account for pore pressure prognosis during drilling well design. Furthermore, despite the broad causes of abnormal pressures in the earth's crust, the mathematical prediction models that use either well logs or seismic data only predict pore pressure generated by stress-related mechanisms; this is also know as "compaction disequilibrium" or "undercompaction". Figure 1 shows a pressure-depth plot illustrating the existence of other pore pressure mechanisms, which must be taken into account to improve pressure predictions.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Hence, because shales are more sensitive to undercompaction phenomena, the prognosis of abnormal pressures focuses on their behavior (Hottmann, and Johnson 1965; Bowers 2002). However, when we have reservoir type rocks (sands or carbonates), the prognosis of pore pressure using well logs or seismic data do not match altogether with recorded pore pressures (Green et al. 2016; Hoskin and O'Connor 2016). Figure 2 describes pore pressure prognosis behavior in a shale and reservoir type rock (sands). The black dots are pore pressure values measured in a reservoir type rock; the continuous line represent the predicted pore pressure values determined from well logs.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The most commonly used pore pressure models in industry are based on the theory of normal sediment compaction described by Terzaghi and Peck (1948). Here the pore pressure models consider the behavior of porosity (or porosity indicators such as sonic transit time, resistivity or interval velocity) with depth to define the compaction disequilibrium; this behavior is called normal compaction trend (NCT). Shaker (2007a, 2007b) discussed the importance of NCT in pore pressure prediction and show examples of NCT data manipulation for calibration purposes. Figure 3 shows the NCT plotted correctly against a NCT plotted in several segments with the purpose of fitting pore pressure measured values.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">A systemic approach called "convergence analysis" was followed in this paper, which includes: the definition of Normal Compaction Trend (NCT), the determination of Fluid Retention Depth (FRD), setting up of divergent area, an overburden correction by effect of density log and the fitting of a pore pressure model. Figure 4 schematizes the different elements integrated in the convergence analysis.</p><div id="link-4">

If the NCT represents the porosity loss with depth, then any well would have a unique NCT as shown in figure 5 (dashed line).

<p id="Ancr9">As burial depth increase, porosity reduces until a depth known as Fluid Retention Depth (FRD); from there down, porosity increases in abnormal way and pore pressure changes from a normal to an abnormal pattern. For the same well, FRD must be the same using any well log to identify it (figure 8). Swarbrick et al. (2002) underline the fact that the beginning of an abnormal pore pressure is controlled by the loading rate, the evolution of porosity and permeability of sediments during burial. The FRD is shallower in sedimentary rocks with low permability and high compressibility, and deeper in highly permeable and -low compressible rocks. In addition, for the same sediment, the FRD is shallower for high sedimentation rates and deeper for slow sedimentation rates.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">Terzaghi and Peck (1948) postulate that the overburden stress is shared by both, the fluids into the rock pores and the contact among grains; the intergranular contact stress is called effective stress (figure 10). In addition, they propose that if the pore fluid expulsion is interrupted, pore pressure increases because overburden stress increases. Hence, divergent lines and Terzaghi's model can be used to calculate pore pressure due to compaction disequilibrium as it increases when the overburden does (figure 11), as follows:</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">The methodology of divergent area can be applied to the reservoir rocks that do not follow in all the compaction theory of shales. Green et al. (2016) argue that one of the reasons that traditional prediction of pore pressure fails in carbonates is because the loss of porosity is not only controlled by effective stress but also by a variety of physical parameters such as depositional conditions, dissolution and diagenetic fabric history; the same occurs for sands according with Mouchet and Mitchell (1989). Figure 13 shows an illustration of underprediction of pore pressure due to porosity affected by other parameters different to compaction (modified from Green et al. 2016).</p><div id="link-13">
