<p id="Ancr5">For this step, each well is simulated through a streamline simulator (in this study, FRONTSIM). Each producer is set to produce with a BHP limit to illustrate their maximum flow potential. The results from this step are (i) flow potential from each well and (ii) streamlines traced from each producer to the boundary (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The objective of this step is to map data from the streamlines to each simulation grid for further calculations. Generally, the generated streamlines data is in line format, which is stored in .SLN files. One single grid may be penetrated by more than one line. The MATLAB binary reader is used to extract information from the .SLN file and to calculate the average time-of-flight from the line to each grid. The result can accurately mimic the streamline time-of-flight result to the grid (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">Instead of running reservoir simulations, we perform a proxy calculation of the drainage volume by turning the effective HC drainage volume into a mathematical matrix union with a given number of wells, and then search for the case that provides the largest score. The calculation of a matrix union can be done at an extremely fast speed, less than 0.1 second per trial, which make the exhaustive search possible. Additionally, a parallel computing technique can also be implemented into this workflow to further expedite the computational efficiency. The overall exhaustive optimisation workflow is illustrated in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

The workflow from running streamline simulator, digitizing streamlines, calculating efficient drainage volume and optimizing by exhaustive search are included in the package using the MATLAB compiler.

<p id="Ancr16">With heterogeneity, the drainage area is not circular as in the homogeneous case, but the drainage is extended toward the preferred flow-path with a high permeability trend in a NE-SW direction (Fig. 13). Additionally, the high permeability regions are primarily located in southern part of the reservoir. This information suggests the majority of development wells should focus on the southern region more than the northern region. The proper number of wells in each region is the primary requirement for this study where the SMARTDRAIN serves as the key engine to deliver the answer.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr19">The primary requirement of Field × development is a plateau production period. The result from the two scenarios, manual justification and optimisation by SMARTDRAIN, are compared in Fig. 16. It can be observed that the well placement suggested by SMARTDRAIN has improved the plateau duration by 5.1% more than from manual justification. Despite various attempts from manual justification to locate well placement on scenarios with proper well spacing size, an improvement from this algorithm-assisted workflow has been clearly shown to occur. This improvement also proves the necessity of integrated reservoir simulations to improve decision-making on selections for well placement.</p><div id="link-16">
