<p id="Ancr1">This re-development concept calls for the construction of four artificial islands (Figure 1), which will host the drilling of the majority of all new wells, as well as hosting the processing and treatment surface facilities for all the production and injection fluids. As part of the plans to increase and sustain production from the field, over 360 extended reach MRC wells are planned, consisting of both oil producers, water injectors and potentially Water-Alternating-Gas (WAG) injector wells.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">Simulations for deployment of the 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion (Figure 9) showed that without the drillpipe swivel, if friction factors exceeded 0.25FC then it was unlikely that the liner would be able to be deployed to bottom. With the ability to selectively rotate the drillpipe running string an additional 80,000lbs of hookload is gained at 0.2FC.

<p id="Ancr13">When deploying the 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion there were no issues until the liner reached the sidetrack point (Figure 13).

This was evaluated to be when the 1st of the 14 swellpackers were pushed past the openhole whipstock sidetrack, due to the high DLS at this point. At 25,567ft MD the hookload dropped to 100Klbs (Block weight of the DDM) and the drillpipe running string was rotated to try to alleviate the buckling.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr21">The same technologies as used on Well 3 were used on this 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion; such as casing swivel position over 5,000ft from the top of the 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion (Figure 21) and bonded centralisers above this point. The pore pressure and length of the lateral allowed the standard RDF NAF system to be used, and the same best practices such as low DLS (1.3deg/100ft), good hole cleaning, etc were incorporated into the drilling and prior steps, before running the 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr22">Like previous wells the preparatory work that had been done prior to deployment of the 6-5/8” horizontal lower completion, allowed the successful deployment without the need for rotation (Figure 22). In this case history deployment friction factors were 0.1 - 0.15FC and this is consistent with previous wells.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr23">Prior to this well the benefits of the casing swivel had not actually been realised, as it had not been required to be rotated. Before execution it was decided to determine the hookload gains and required surface torque when rotating above the casing swivel when the 6 5/8” lower completion was at toal depth (Figure 23).</p><div id="link-23">
