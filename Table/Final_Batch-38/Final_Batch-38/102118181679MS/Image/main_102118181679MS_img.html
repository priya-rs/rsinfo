<p id="Ancr7">The Wolfcamp Shale formation is a hydrocarbon-producing zone in the Permian Basin (Figure 1). Located in West Texas and extending into the southeast portion of New Mexico, it is primarily a basinal structure. Covering the Midland, Delaware and Central Platform sub-basins (Scotia Howard Heil, 2014; Schwartz et al., 2015), it varies in thickness depending on where it is located, with some areas exceeding 2,000 ft.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Case 1 is an example of frac fluid (Table 1) and hydrocarbon (Table 2) tracers being utilized to show the effects of existing faults intersecting a wellbore. There was little indication during the hydraulic fracture stimulation that traced segments 7 and 8 were treated differently than the surrounding segments. Post-frac flowback/production fluid tracer analyses indicated that these zones were not contributing into the wellbore flow stream (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

The four-panel image (Figure 9) helps illustrate the extent of communication. Each wellbore is highlighted to show the unique tracer that was injected in that wellbore (Red is Iridium, Yellow is Scandium and Blue is Antimony). Panel A is a composite image of all the proppant tracers detected in each wellbore. As is evident from the image, all three proppant tracers were observed in all three wellbores. Multiple tracer types in a single wellbore indicate that proppant has intersected an offset well during some part of the stimulation treatment.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">ase 5 examines the amount of frac fluid communication between two hydraulic fractured horizontal wellbores that were zipper fracture completed and the effects of two preexisting vertical wells. The vertical wells had been producing for approximately two years prior to stimulating the two horizontal wells. Each horizontal well utilized 11 unique frac fluid tracers (CFTs). Produced fluid samples were collected from all four wells and analyzed to determine the magnitude of the offset well fluid communication. Figure 10 shows a top down view of all four wells and their location in relation to each other. Well 2 and Well 3 are the horizontal wells. Well 1 and Well 4 are the preexisting vertical wells. Shown across each horizontal well are 11 traced colored segments.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr18">Along with the increase of production for all types of wells in both basins in the Wolfcamp, the proficiency of operators to drill and complete these wells improved. The percent proppant coverage had a slight increase in both basins (Figure 12), which is a good measure of the proppant behind pipe and indicates the success of the frac program. This increase implies that companies were more likely to refine their completion techniques over time to cause this increase in coverage, which should lead to an increase in hydrocarbon production.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr19">Completion programs for each well are critical for the ultimate fate of the well, but there is also much to learn about how these wells are produced and clean up over the early stages of production. To visualize this, the water profile effectiveness (WPE), a measure of how evenly the frac fluid cleans up from the well, was used. A scale of 1 to 10 is utilized with 10 being the best a well could achieve. Figure 13 shows the typical upward trend observed when plotting an individual company's wells over the lifetime of the program.</p><div id="link-13">
