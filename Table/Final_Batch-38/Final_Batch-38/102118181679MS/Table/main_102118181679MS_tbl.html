Some effects are still observed in this example as shown in Table 3 specifically in traced segments 18 to 15 and 14 to 13 which are on either side of the known fault. After approximately two weeks, flowback/production was finally achieved from these intervals once the wellbore bottomhole pressures were reduced. This type of study led to lower completion costs by bypassing zones that were unproductive.</p><p><b>Table 3</b> Frac Fluid Tracers - Identifying Faults</p><p>Table 3 Frac Fluid Tracers - Identifying Faults</p><table id="102118181679MS-Tbl_SPi-3" frame="hsides">

Stage 8 was not stimulated due to the presence of an observed fracture on the well log. As the samples were taken, it was observed that the heel stages (traced segments 10 to 13) were lagging in flowback/production throughout the 115 days of sampling. A review of the available geologic data indicated that the heel portion of the lateral showed more natural fractures than the remaining portion of the lateral and that it was slightly depleted by a combination of increased permeability from the natural fractures and nearby existing vertical wellbores.</p><p><b>Table 5</b> Frac Fluid Tracers - High Permeability</p><p>Table 5 Frac Fluid Tracers - High Permeability</p><table id="102118181679MS-Tbl_SPi-5" frame="hsides">
