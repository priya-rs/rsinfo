However, due to limited time of the project, and the long running time (10 to 20 hours), the simple closed loop as explained in Figure 10 is used. Detailed matrix table explaining the control being used in this simulation can be seen in Table 1: Some runs were simulated to test different strategy in applying smart completion. Different combination of ICD/ICV application in producer alone, injector alone, and both producer and injector together were simulated.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> Simulation Matrix Table</p><p>Table 1 Simulation Matrix Table</p><table id="102118176385MS-Tbl_SPi-1" frame="hsides">
