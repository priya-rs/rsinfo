The larger scale faults downthrow to the east and subdivide the field into four main areas (see Figure 4): the West Flank North, West Flank South, Frontal Central, and Frontal South Panel, with limited to no communication between panels. Field compartmentalisation by sub-seismic faults is supposed to be part of the reason for poor sweep efficiency across the field.</p><div id="link-4">

Each segment has zero, one, or more connections with the reservoir grid blocks. For each segment there are four equations (assuming a three phase black oil simulation): three material balance equations and a pressure drop equation. The pressure drop equation includes hydrostatic, acceleration and friction effects. The equations are solved to obtain the pressure, flow rate, and fluid composition in each segment (Youngs et al. 2009).</p><div id="link-5">

However, due to limited time of the project, and the long running time (10 to 20 hours), the simple closed loop as explained in Figure 10 is used. Detailed matrix table explaining the control being used in this simulation can be seen in Table 1: Some runs were simulated to test different strategy in applying smart completion.

<p id="Ancr22">From the tornado chart (Figure 19.a), it can be seen that the ‘PETEX 4-ICV with 50% water cut’ case gives better recovery than the ‘PETEX 4-ICV 70% water cut’ case while in the Mukherjee-Brill correlation case, the ‘ICV with 50% water cut’ case gives less gain than the ‘ICV with 70% water cut’ case. This is because PETEX 4 has less tubing pressure losses hence production can be better sustained. With the Mukherjee-Brill correlation, the tubing pressure losses are higher, hence in its ‘50% water cut’ case, with the same choking condition, the well could not sustain production at the same THP. The simulator could not find the working point in the VLP table given, and the well shuts. This is also due to the fact that at higher GOR, the VLP curves are flipped (see Figure 20).</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr23">Sensitivity run with higher injection was carried out using Mukherjee-Brill correlation (the chosen VLP correlation for the base case). It can be seen in Figure 19.b that ‘ICV with 50% water cut’ gives the highest recovery. This is due to the higher depletion during early time in the heel section (see Figure 21, year 2022) which made this section release more gas, reducing the column weight, thus the well could sustain stable production. After some time, the effect of increasing injection rate reached the heel section of WF16 (see Figure 21, year 2024), the 50% water cut limit resulting in choking the water and allowing more oil to be produced.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr26">The tornado chart (see Figure 24.a) shows that with the same ICD/ICV valve size, multiplying the permeability of the heel by 10 gives detrimental result in the ICD case. This is due to higher contribution from the heel section resulting in lower contribution from the toe section. In the cases where toe permeability is set at 70 mD and in the case where the heel is closed, ICD/ICV lead to similar gains than in the reference case. This proves that in the case where more heterogeneity is encountered, ICD/ICV could help optimizing the recovery.</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr33">The main consideration to decide the zoning in the wellbore is based on the prediction of the ability to flow for each zone. The flow in front of the same ICD segment must be homogeneous. A good indication to estimate the productivity is based on permeability contrast and saturation value. It’s wise to separate the high and low oil saturation area into different zones, to avoid cross flow within the same zone. It can be seen in Figure E-1, the different zoning in 8 ICDs case and 4 ICDs case.</p><div id="link-31">
