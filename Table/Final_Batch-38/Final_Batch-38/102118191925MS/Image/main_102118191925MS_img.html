<p id="Ancr1">The distance between block-7E and Platform E and the depth of the target locations restrict drilling serviceable deviated and slanted wells crossing the primary targets while maintaining well to remain economic. An extended horizontal well was decided the most optimum option to develop reserves in block-7E (Figure 1). Well trajectory for PHW-2 is an extended reach well (i.e. information on how long the section towards landing point and how long its open-hole reservoir penetrated length) in a relatively shallow and thin reservoir to maximize net pay thickness while maintain operating serviceability. This required advance completion to reach out to total depth with some level of zonal control or self-regulating against water invasion to extend oil life.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Fluid PVT in Sand I reservoir was defined as oil with API of 37 grades, bubble point pressure of 2675 psi, oil density of 52.4 lbm/ft3 with an initial Rs of 0.696 MSCF/STB. SCAL data is not available, instead analog data was used for similar reservoir type and depth from West and East flanks collectively. Sand package Sand I is subdivided into four sub-flow units: Sand I, Sand II, Sand III and Sand IV, all interpreted to be oil saturated and sharing the same OWC. In between these units a shale of 5 to 10 ft is interpreted from open hole logs in Exp-6 well (Figure 2). The lateral continuity of these thin shale section along the whole block is unknown and beyond the seismic resolution, but they could potentially act as barrier limiting vertical fluid flow.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">With a long horizontal wellbore in this extended drilling condition, a major challenge is the delay of water coning and control of water cut once water breaks through into the wellbore. A field proven solution is to employ nozzle-type Inflow Control Devices (ICD) (See Figure 4) to purposely respond to high mobility fluid flows into the well (i.e water or gas) in terms of higher Bernoulli's induced back-pressure against the high-surge influx.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Due to no PSD data and also no core from this block, to select an optimal premium screen nominal opening, a 3-D (or thick-bed) filter medium was selected for the screen. This type of screen filter medium can efficiently control a wide range of formation particle sizes and not easily plugged. The Figure 5 illustrates how the flow area through a 2D type filter can be very quickly reduced by the natural sand pack bridging on screen slot opening. The 3D filter, however, allows a permeable medium to be formed by the combination of the filter itself and the medium range formation grains that get trapped inside the medium. This helps retain a wider range of grain sizes and maintains a large flow area for liquid and fines to pass through the packed medium.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Alpha-Beta-wave (See Figure 6) packing was chosen as the placement method for the gravel pack. This technique has proven suitable for wellbores drilled with water-based fluids and for formations (in this well) that have a large gap between formation pore pressure and frac pressure, allowing the circulating pressure during the beta-wave placement to never exceed the formation frac pressure. The risks of an incomplete gravel pack using this technique are significant based on past records, especially in the presence of reactive shales or when fracture pressure can easily be exceeded. Although a higher cost option using alternate path screens of beta-beta-wave packing could have mitigated these risks, the cost sensitive nature of the project drove the decision toward Alpha-Beta water packing and to rely on the 3D filter screens to provide the needed additional insurance against an incomplete pack.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 7 summarizes the ICD design workflow for first horizontal well in S-field East Flank. This workflow is divided into three stages which is pre-drill feasibility modeling, real-time modeling and post-drilling evaluation. During the pre-drilling stage, the model is constructed based on offset well data in the East Flank such as reservoir properties, PVT data and etc. Then, 3D dynamic modeling was conducted to optimize the ICD-nozzles’ configuration and packer placement in order to simulate the oil production gain and water/gas reduction against the base case (open hole). In the real-time phase, the pre-drill model is updated and calibrated with the Logging-While-Drilling (LWD) real-time data while the data is retrieved batch-by-batch while drilling until total depth (TD).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">Prior to ICD optimization, a base case (OH) was run in a dynamic simulation to validate the model with respect to the expected fluid in-place (oil, gas and water), FBHP and well productivity index (PI). This is followed by an ICD optimization simulation that was performed with different parameters conditions at each run such as constant nozzle size, varying nozzle sizes, different number of packers and their placements. Figure 10 demonstrated the ICD's contribution to suppress water influx from Sand II layer that had high permeability in order to re-distribute a more uniform influx across the entire length of the horizontal interval in this open hole multi-zone completion. This in return boost more oil from lower-water cut sections.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">Strategically, the ICD fine tuning process of Well PHW-2 based on 9 compartments was proven to be significant in optimizing the nozzles’ configuration before running in hole. As observed in Figure 14, the LWD-derived permeability was significantly different from heel to toe section as compared to the pre-drilled reservoir model's profile. Hence, this verifies the real-time ICD modeling and finetuning is extremely important to optimize the ICD configuration based on actual LWD-derived data prior to RIH. If the ICD's pressure-drop design was based on the previous predrilled reservoir properties, the ultimate oil production benefits of ICD is not optimized.</p><div id="link-14">

The 3D dynamic simulation was iterated according to the time-lapse changes of reservoir properties, fluid saturation and fluid distribution in Sand I, Sand II and Sand III for base case (OH). The cross-section demonstrated that the water first breakthorugh at toe section through Sand I and Sand II after 2 years (mid-production). Without ICD control, the strong water continued flowing through Sand II toward the wellbore at toe section after 5 years (late-production) due to aquifer charging phenomenon.
