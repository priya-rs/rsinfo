<p id="Ancr1">The study area located in the southern Gulf of Thailand, approximately 150 km from Kota Bharu and 260 km from Songkhla with water depth ranging from 50-60 m (Figure 1). Numerous gas fields have been developed, mostly at relatively shallow stratigraphic levels of Late Miocene sequences and very high carbon dixode reported toward the flanks of the area. This integrated study provides an updated of geological perspective and asociared non-commercial gases to reduce the exploration risk and contribute in assessing the remaining hydrocarbon potential resources in JDA area for future investment decisions.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Subsequently from Mid to Late Miocene, structural inversion had occurred causing the re-activation of Malay Basin axial shear zone, from left to right lateral during Middle Miocene (Madon, 1997). This inversion event was marked by the Miocene-Pliocene unconformity and thermal subsidence was taking place from Miocene to Recent. The "steer-head" geometry of the basin flanks is typical of a rift-sag basin formed by crustal extension (Madon et al., 2004) as shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">For example, Figure 3 shows δ13CCO2 and δ13CCH4 for samples from various depths in the nearby field. The isotope data indicate that the samples contain mixed CO2 derived by different mechanisms from two sources. Partial least squares (PLS) regression of δ13CCO2 and δ13CCH4 and depth for 61 samples from the nearby field, where %CO2 was set as the dependent variable, resulted in a systematic correlation between predicted and measured %CO2.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The model was used to predict the mass of CO2 generated as a function of burial history throughout the study area. Figure 4 is a simple example of calculated mass of CO2 that assumes a constant burial heating rate of 3.85°C/My. Clearly, CO2 from thermal decomposition of kerogen will occur at lower temperatures and shallower depths than decomposition of carbonate minerals in basement rocks. Migration of the CO2 was modeled using temperature-pressure solubility curves for free gas vapor and dissolved gas in water.</p><div id="link-4">
