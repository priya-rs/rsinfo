<p id="Ancr6">No gas injectors (GI) were drilled and completed on the east part of Azeri field. However, well performance data along with pressure and later gas tracer data suggested Central Azeri (CA) gas injectors were infact also impacting the North Flank (NF) of East Azeri. The Bottom Hole Temperature (BHT) data from 4 EA producers closest to the CA sector showed decrease in BHT temperature of those wells nearest the gas injector once GI started-up (Figure 6)(Hutchinson et al., 2007). It was noted that the injection rates into the closest water injectors and producers had remained relatively stable with no change in choke size. This observation was confirmed by gas tracer data analysed later and was modelled based on existing reservoir model (Mammadli et al., 2014).</p><div id="link-6">

BHT data from AzW9 well and wells AzW10 and AzW11, shown in Figure 12, suggest no communication between these three wells. There were no pressure drop observed in AzW9 well with AzW10 start-up, instead there was pressure stabilization and even some increase of BHP observed in that well with other producers start ups.
