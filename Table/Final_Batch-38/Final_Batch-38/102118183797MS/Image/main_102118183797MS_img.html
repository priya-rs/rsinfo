<p id="Ancr1">Bahrain Field is an asymmetrical anticline trending in the north-south direction. The field comprises 22 multi-stack carbonate and sandstone reservoirs (Figure 1) with the hydrocarbon content varying from tarry oil in the shallow Aruma to dry gas in the deeper Khuff reservoirs. The geology of the field is complex with a large number of faults occurring in the Wasia group formations, which contain the major oil reservoir of the Bahrain field, the Mauddud reservoir which is the subject of this paper.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Mauddud is a Middle Cretaceous carbonate deposited on a shallow-to-open marine carbonate ramp that is today’s Arabian shelf. Numerous low-relief faults juxtapose Mauddud against overlying Wara and underlying Nahr-Umr, part of the Bahrain zone reservoirs (Figure 1). The average porosity, permeability and thickness are 27%, 25 md and 110’ respectively (Figure 2). The Mauddud reservoir is subdivided into the upper Mauddud A (also called Ba) and lower Mauddud B (also called Bb) intervals.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Crestal gas injection for pressure maintenance has been used in the central area of the Mauddud reservoir since 1938. Open-hole logs have been used to track the expansion of the gas cap and Oil-Cater Contact (OWC) over several decades. The current gas caps in Mauddud A, Mauddud B and OWC are shown in Figure 3. Owing to structural extent and differing Petrophysical characteristics, the gas cap has mainly expanded in the Mauddud A and to a smaller extent in Mauddud B. Since Mauddud A gas cap is now approaching the top of the oil-water transition zone, gas production has increased beyond the capacity of the surface gas handling equipment.</p><div id="link-3">

After 2 years of gas injection, the areas with new injectors showed trends of positive oil CumHI associated with increase in gas CumHI indicating the incremental oil response from increased gas injection. Additionally, water CumHI decreased substantially in those areas. Another observation from this study was the trends of oil and gas cumHI indicated gas streamlines in NW-SE direction which aligns with the understanding of the major faults and fracture networks in the Mauddud reservoir.</p><div id="link-10">

The GOR after the workovers often drops by more than an order of magnitude (eg. 70 mscf/stb to 1 mscf/stb) which brings them below the marginal GOR limit and become producible. Shown in Figure 12 is a good example of what can be achieved with an effective gas shut-off workover.</p><div id="link-14">

As can be seen, most of the oil production has been restored to the pre shut-in level with a significant reduction in gas and water production. The 2016 workover program had fewer wells and resulted with only half of them as successful workovers. Reasons of low success rate in 2016 are still under evaluation but are most likely due to the pumping pressure during the acid-wash treatment where it was seen that fracturing pressure was exceeded during stimulation.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr22">The oil drop in this area was seen within the 2nd month of the trial, as shown in Figure 20. The wells closest to injectors A-0645 and A-0557 showed a drop in gross liquid and gas production soon after the injectors were shut-in. An example of the drop is seen in Figure 21 where the gas and oil decreased and water cut increased, leading to a drop in well head pressure. In this example, the well manifold pressure is also monitored to ensure that no surface facility issue is causing the change in well behavior.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr24">Pressure surveys in phase 2 were done in the same manner as phase 1. Figure-22 shows the pressure maps at different times in the area. The results indicated higher drop in the east (area E) compared to the west (area D), which indicates that the injection in the west was strongly supporting the east due to the areal pressure gradient between the two areas.</p><div id="link-24">
