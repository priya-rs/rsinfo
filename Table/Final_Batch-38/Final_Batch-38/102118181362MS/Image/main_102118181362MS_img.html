<p id="Ancr1">According to formula (3), we can generate initial channel centerline which is composed of a lot of control points equally spaced (Fig.1). From the bank retreat equation, the positions of control points d each migration computation can be determined. These simulated points are linked together using cubic spline function to get the simulated channel centerline at each simulation stages. As shown in Fig.1, the centreline 1 was transformed to centerline 2.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">As shown in Fig. 5, the compound meander belt model consists of 4 zones. The bottom surface of zone 2 with grid lines was shown. The plan extent of zone 2 was divided into 2 areas, the simulation area which indicate the channel belt and un-simulation area which indicate inter channel deposits or flood plain. The large scale facies distribution in plane can be determined easily according to limited well logs and seismic attribute study. For example, the maximum amplitude attribute can be used to determine the lateral geometry of meander belt.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The reservoir is in the Minghuazhen formation at an average depth of 1100m. The vertical reservoir profile is composed of 2-3 fining up cycles. Each cycle corresponds to a single meander belt. Each meander belt is formed due to long term migration, swing and repeatedly cutoff of multiple meandering rivers. The internal architecture of each meander belt becomes more complicated with lateral division of abandoned channels(Fig.8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">Firstly, we need to characterize the single channel belt and construct the compound channel belt model. Because the tops and bases of the channel belts can not be resolved independently from the seismic data, their horizontal extent can be determined. An inter well 3D correlation technique was used to characterize the channel distribution and internal structure of compound meander belt. As shown in Fig.12, the NmI3 zone was subdivided into 2 to 3 sub-zones, the reservoir architecture was well reproduced.</p><div id="link-12">
