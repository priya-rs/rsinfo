<p id="Ancr3">These fieldsareall mature fields with production from 3 reservoir intervals: the Agrio, Lower Troncoso and Rayoso (Figure 2). Both the Agrio and Lower Troncoso unitswithshoreface and eolian deposits represent among the best reservoirs in the country and show excellent fluid properties (2-6 cp oil viscosity). Traditionally the Rayoso Fm. with less attractive fluid properties (20-10,000 cp oil viscosity) was seen as a secondary target.</p><div id="link-2">

With the exception of early production from the most prolific reservoir, the Lower Troncoso, wells have generally produced commingled from 2-3 units. All the reservoir units have excellent petrophysical characteristics, however the oil in the Agrio and Lower Troncoso reservoirs has a viscosity of 4-6cp while in Rayoso Fm.it is 18-22 cp.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The history match of these wells would enable anassessment ofwhether the modelled static and dynamic properties were plausible for these formations. For the Rayoso Fm., only one well was solely completed in this reservoir. The production history of this wellis shown in Figure 5 in which it can be that there is a high water cut even when the well was brought on-stream, the produced water being formation water, not injection water. This suggested that the Rayoso formation was deep in the transition zone and therefore waspredominantly water bearing.</p><div id="link-5">

The perforations between 579m-653m are linked to Rayoso, the deeper perforations are linked to Lower Troncoso and Agrio. Each perforation represents a single sand with a total of 17 perforations at the last count means that water is being injected 17 separate sands although some of the perforations may be combined due to the effects of fracturing.</p><div id="link-6">

In figure 7, the top three graphs show a comparison of simulated and measured RFT's after initial history matching of the simulation model. The lower line represents the RFT match for the same wells with the historical water injection reallocated.

<p id="Ancr9">The history match unfortunately demonstrated that the potential in the deeper Lower Troncoso and Agrio formation was limited. Due to uncertainty in production and injection allocation, the simulation model could give a history match either if Rayoso was fully oil saturated was in a transition zone. Resistivity logs were consulted to see if these gave a clearer indication of saturation. Consistently, the logs showed resistivities increasing moving from the OWC to the top of the Rayoso Fm. (Figure 8) indicating the presence of oil.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">Studying the Rayoso Fm. in neighboring producing fields (see Figure 9) and applying lessons from geological characterization and dynamic modelling between fields enabled modeling speed to increase. Some of these shared lessons are discussed in the subsequent Reducing Uncertainty in the Rayoso section. As a result, a subsequent study of the DBE field took less than 3 months of modelling effort. Subsequent modelling of the Chachahuen Field, an extension of DBE field lying to its South West, was completed in a few weeks.</p><div id="link-9">

Geometries of these truncations have been mapped across the fields and extrapolated regionally, in order to model stratigraphic traps distribution.

The most important reservoir sands are identified above sequence boundaries surfaces and display the best reservoir characteristics, and are correlatable regionally (Figure 12). The regional surfaces, above which best reservoirs sands are identified, representa reservoir architecture and provide boundaries to dynamic flow units. These units can and are used to subdivide the reservoir for all model scales required, in this case region, field and sector sizes.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr20">A consistent observation across the three fields is that a non-reservoir facies coexists within the same cycle as the reservoir sands in all the reservoir formations, not just Rayoso, an example is shown from DBE in Figure 19. To ensure that an accurate saturation model is created, it was essential that the reservoir facies and non-reservoir facies are identified and their respective petrophysical properties modelled separately. If this practice was not followed, in the simulation model what was immobile water in non-reservoir as identified in logs would become mobile water that is produced in preference to oil, making a history match impossible.</p><div id="link-19">

<p id="Ancr21">Figure 20 below shows water saturation as percentage of the total rock volume for DB. Only the 5% highest permeability and furthest rock from the OWC is at irreducible water saturation. The remainder shows lower oil saturations and in some cases both oil and water are mobile at initial conditions, i.e. that the Rayoso formation lies in a transition zone. This was repeated on DBE as wells drilled before water injection and away from OWC's will not produce exclusively dry oil initially. However water production often declined as the tighter rock loses energy. Similar experiences have been seen in Chachahuen and Puesto Hernandez.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr22">Production data and history match results confirmed that water injection has increased ultimate oil recovery on DBE. In Figure 21 it can be seen that the water injection started in 2006 has enabled an oil plateau to be maintained. However the water cut is predicted to rise with time while recovery factors at the moment are lower than desired.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr23">The minimal water injection in the reservoir combined with the low GOR of Rayoso Oil meant that there was little energy to displace oil towards producer wells. To effectively develop the Rayoso it would be necessary to have injectors that are only completed in the Rayoso. Even in this case water injection will be inefficient due to the high viscosity of the Rayoso oil, estimated to lie between 18-22 cp in DB. Looking at the history matched relative permeability for DB shown in Figure 22, the mobility ratio based on endpoints is 12 so the stability of the water displacement is low.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr24">In Figure 23 of a late DB well drilled in 2014, we can see that water breakthrough has occurred at a depth of around 580.5-582 m TVDSS, the thickness of the water sweep is around 1.5m in a sand that is over 7m thick. This demonstrating that a large volume of oil has been bypassed due to water under ride. Note the higher resistivity in this well as compared to previous well resistivities (Figure 14) which is a result of injecting fresh water. Although the water injection as discussed previously is immature, the underlying physics as a result of the adverse mobility ratio mean that even if thevolume of water injection is significantly upgraded, it will take the injection of a number of pore volumes of water and hence a long time to achieve a desirable recovery factor.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr25">However, to design the pilot and determine optimum polymer concentration, expected water, tracer and polymer breakthrough times, a high resolution sector model was required. Such a model was also needed to assess the different flows and potential breakthrough times in the multiple Rayoso reservoir cycles. With a regional static model and an understanding of the Rayoso Fm., it was possible to quickly construct a high resolution pilot sector model. This location and extent of this model is shown in Figure 24.</p><div id="link-24">

This model was subsequently used to assess the operating parameters for water and polymer injection and to design a tracer program. In the future the model will be compared to actual data for tracer breakthrough, incremental oil production and finally polymer breakthrough times.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr27">Potential incremental volumes from a regional massification of polymer injection are estimated by a combination of integrated modelling or analogue to be a significant number of times larger than have been identified for DB Rayoso only. With oil viscosity rapidly increasing towards the SE of the area, it is expected that the experience gained in modelling and implementing polymer flooding in DB and DBE will be applied in the more challenging and viscous oils of Cerro Hamaca Oeste. Static and dynamic models have already been used to justify the extension of waterflooding SE from DB into ChuS. Figure 26 shows projects currently under consideration</p><div id="link-26">
