<p id="Ancr7">From all formations of Phisanulok basin stratigraphy (Figure 1), two formations are defined as tight reservoirs. The first is deltaic-lacustrine reservoirs of the Lan Krabu (LKU) formation. This formation is thin-bedded reservoirs with high heterogeneity and structural compartmentalization. The tight targets are found in all sub-reservoir members depending on depth and location. The second is the alluvio-lacustrine reservoirs of the Sarabop formation, which is the alluvio-lacustrine reservoirs. This formation is the interbedded silty-sandstone with poorly sorted and high heterogeneity. This formation is the early sedimentation event of Phitsanulok basin that has lower degree of structural compartmentalization when compared with the LKU formation. In general, both targets are the focused areas of hydraulic fracturing campaigns.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Hydraulic fracturing was implimented for the first time in Sirikit oilfield more than a decade ago. Additional pilot wells have been continually performed ever since. The stimulated wells are mostly deviated which were typically completed with 2 7/8" tubing in 7" casing to put on production. The latest pilot HFA campaign was executed at two wells which are deviated and horizontal wells drilled through the LKU formations. There are seven stages of hydraulic fracturing: two stages in LZ-1 deviated well and five stages in LX-1 horizontal well (Figure 2). Six stages were successfully accomplished, while the first stage of LZ-1 had encountered premature screen-out due to equipment malfunction.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">Field-scale implementation of hydraulic fracturing will be continued in the areas where production gain was proven to deliver positive economic value. These areas (Figure 3) usually equip with strong subsurface model. More infill development wells are continuously being drilled and dedicated for hydraulic fracturing in tight reservoirs. The information gathered from actual pumping operation and production analysis from former pilot campaigns is used to improve the understanding of subsurface quality and expected hydraulic fracture geometry.</p><div id="link-3">

Additionally, the HFB campaign aimed to also perform hydraulic fracturing in the unproven areas and formations. For LB-1, the Sarabop formation was focused in this campaign and it has the relatively shallower hydraulic fracturing target depth than in the proven area. In addition, TE-1 well was targeted to perform hydraulic fracturing in the untested sublayers of LKU formations, which are the deepest targets in this campaign.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr13">The detailed study revealed that when considered in relative to those connected with other concepts, utilization of "plug-and-perforation technique on the cemented production casing (7") with retrievable fracturing string and packer as depicted in Figure 7, tends to concern lower associated costs; less special tools and contractor service packages required; shorter time spent on well drilling; no major modification to the conventional well design in the field; and less tendency to long non-productive-time (NPT) caused by operational difficulties. Thus, it was selected as a primary configuration for the campaign. In this configuration, once a bridge plug has been set and the target has been perforated by wireline runs, pumping job is conducted through four-inch-diameter drill pipe, as a frac string, during the treatment.</p><div id="link-7">

Other fracture measurement applications including anisotropy analysis of and the analysis of temperature distribution between pre- and post-job were also applied on selected wells for vertical containment approximation. The fracture dimension - fracture half-length, fracture height, and fracture width - determined for each stage is given in Table 6. According to the results (Figure 16), the created half-length of every job in the proven area appeared to be in-line with that of its pre-job design.

<p id="Ancr23">On a per-stage basis, the jobs in this campaign HFB were approximately 24% quicker, while spending 31% less in cost, than those of the HFA (pilot) campaign as shown in Figure 17 where the comparision to those of their predecessors can aslo be qualitatively implied. Our analysis on time and cost model developed by grouping tasks sharing the same core elements of activities of frac operation on a well (similar to the development of the project time and cost model used for strategy determination prio to the campaign) allowed more accurate evaluation of time and cost effectiveness associated with each frac stage.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr24">The production performances were closely monitored which revealed different productivity among fracturing stages. Two hydraulic fracturing stages within the same producer, but at different sublayers in same formation, can apparently yield diverse production rates. Figure 18 shows that the rates can be significantly varied, for example, the second stage of LZ-3 well, which has the best performance in the campaign, gives oil production rate above 25 times higher than some poor stages in some wells. This variation can be observed from the hydraulic fractured wells both in the proven and unproven areas. For instance, the TE-1 well, located in the unproven area and formations, show substantial difference of almost 16 times of oil production rate between two stages which are only about 80 meters apart.</p><div id="link-18">
