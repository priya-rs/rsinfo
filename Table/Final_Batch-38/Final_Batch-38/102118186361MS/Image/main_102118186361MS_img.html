<p id="Ancr18">Based on oil saturation, porosity, and permeability of three-dimensional model, we determined the most potential well candidates for injection wells—not only producing wells, but also shut-in wells. There are six selected wells which are MJ-122, MJ-127, MJ-74, MJ-125, MJ-116 and MJ-42 TW (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

On the first day of production, 1 December 2015, the number of bacteria was 1×105 CFU/mL and remain constant until 9 December 2015 with the number of bacteria 1×106 CFU/mL. Bacteria in the first 9 days of production is undergoing a lag phase or adaptation phase. The lag phase period of bacteria in MJ-125 was longer than MJ-122, which was assumed to be caused by internal factors such as the activation of the enzyme and/or external factors such as the limited availability of extracellular compounds so that the accumulation of the required extracellular compounds took longer (Madigan et al., 2012). Bacterial growth increased from December 9, 2015 (the ninth day) until December 16, 2015 (the sixteenth), from 1×106 CFU/mL to 3×108 CFU/mL.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr39">Based on the results of GC-MS analysis (Figure 22) of the samples before and after the injection process (1 to 4 months after injection), it shows that there are changes to the high baseline chromatogram. Compared with a sample before production (September 2015), the samples from the 1st month to the 4th month shows a decrease in baseline after a retention time of 20.00. Similarly, production samples of 5th month compared with the 6th month shows a decrease in baseline after a retention time of 20.00. Decrease in baseline indicates a decline in the amounts of hydrocarbons due to the activity of hydrocarbon degradation by bacteria. The establishment of more peak before the retention time of 15:00 also indicates that the degradation occurs to utilize complex hydrocarbon chains to be simpler hydrocarbon chains.</p><div id="link-22">

Based on the results of GC-MS analysis of the samples before and after the injection process, it can be seen that at the pre-injection, the production of the first month and the second month of production has similar chromatogram pattern. The differences in patterns of chromatograms before and after the production of the first and second month were only observed in the changes of height of peaks, where the decline occurred in the height of peaks between samples before and after the injection process. The changes on peak height indirectly correlated to the change on the concentration number of the sample.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr42">The history of MJ-122 well production performance is shown in Figure 25. In this well, right after the microbial injection period the is water cut decreasing was started at the beginning of the production when the gross rate both decreased and raised. This was intended since we suspected the gross liquid rate should not be that high in order to maintain high numbers of microbes in the reservoirs. Then, after reaching a certain low value of gross liquid production, it was targeted to uprating gross liquid rate up to the original value. However, due to dropped pump efficiency, the gross rate could reach the initial level. Surprisingly, the oil rate was still increased until about 30% even though the gross rate remains the same.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr43">The history of MJ-125 well production performance is shown in Figure 26. It can be obtained that there is an increasing oil rate from 51 BOPD in the beginning to 61 BOPD. This was also supported by the decreasing of 10% of water cut value before implementation of MEOR. This could be meant that water cut did not increase during the increase of gross flow rate, indicates that MEOR performance was successful on this well. This clearly shows that the MJ 125 has a better performance than the MJ-122. We will analyze further in the following.</p><div id="link-26">

MJ-125 well is located at the center, while the MJ-122 well is on the edge of the reservoir model. Principle that used in reservoir simulation is to perform fluid flow matching produced by the fluid PVT data adjustment based on the changes of viscosity data which were obtained in the laboratory. The viscosity data were changed based on the time of MEOR implementation as an adjustment of the changes of fluid characteristics in the reservoir. Thus, the simulation results are able to demonstrate the increasing performance based on these implementations.</p><div id="link-41">

<p id="Ancr62">The simulation of oil production rate necessarily needs to be increased, while the water production needs to be decreased. Therefore, there has to be done an adjustment to the data simulation by adjusting it into a circumstance after the MEOR implementation. The changed parameter is the oil viscosity based on the decrease of the data in the laboratory, the saturated oil residue (Sor) value resulted from biosurfactant forming mechanism and water viscosity. The increase of water viscosity was performed by enhancing the viscosity value of 4.5 times higher than before, so it reached 1.25 cP. Sor value was lowered by 10% from 0,23 into 0,203. Meanwhile, the viscosity of the oil was reduced by 50%, illustrated in Figure 45.</p><div id="link-45">

<p id="Ancr68">Based on Figure 50 and Figure 51, the simulation result is still not match with the trend of production until March 9, 2016. Therefore, a parameter adjustment from the software is necessarily needed to adapt. There is a shut-in period in the early production because of the early simulation period of both wells are the same while in its implementation, MJ-125 well begins producing after MJ-122 well is produced simultaneously. It can be resulted that MEOR implementation enhances the production rate observed from the simulation result.</p><div id="link-51">

In this well, the adjustment was done by lowering the oil viscosity by 20%. In addition, the Sor value was also reduced by 10% due to the production of biosurfactant.

Therefore, it can be said that the laboratory results are matched with the simulation, no need for other adjustment but oil viscosity to be able to adjust the simulation results with field production data. Because the simulation has matched, it can later be conducted a prediction of well performances.</p><div id="link-54">

Restrictions were also performed on the injection well and production well from the pattern. The production well used flow rate limit of each well as many as 400 BFPD, and for the entire field was 800 BFPD. In addition, the restrictions of the injection wells were given rate of 500 BWPD. The prediction was done by making three cases of injection models comparatively varied with their types of length of microbial injection. Every planned case can be studied in this figure below Figure 57.</p><div id="link-57">
