<p id="Ancr3">Field AB is located in offshore Sarawak and structurally is bounded by two growth faults; one at the north and another one at the south (Figure 1). The first oil production started in 1974. Reservoir sand quality is considered good with average porosity of 30% and average permeability of 300mD. Sand is deposited in shoreface environment and homogeneous throughout the field. Gas cap expansion and strong water drive are two major reservoir producing mechanisms.</p><div id="link-1">

The scope of this paper is to share the best practices in two categories: coring operation and also core analyses in the determination of in-situ water saturation and formation water salinity as shown in Figure 2</p><div id="link-2">

Figure 3 shows the type of coring bit used for the job. Due to weakly consolidated nature of the formation, full closure system (FCC) with clamp catcher type was utilized for this job.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Once the core was at surface the laydown cradle was brought to the rig floor via crane. Core was tied at the top, middle and bottom parts to the cradle to minimize flexing or bending during laying down process. Once laid down the actual core recovery was measured. The core was marked every 3ft depth and 6 inch from the top of each 3ft section to be cut. The red and black lines will determine the orientation of the core (top and bottom, see Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

Decision on whether to freeze or not depends on the nature of the rock, consolidated or unconsolidated which is given in the decision tree in Figure 5. The core was placed in stainless steel trough with a closed lid. Liquid nitrogen was then injected through the open compartment of the lid (Figure 6).

Three full 6 in core sections were transported together with the drilled plugs. These sections will be plugged later once arrived in the lab. The plugs and cores took 2 days to arrive in the lab from the field location. In the lab, three main analyses were conducted, namely, Sw Dean Stark, Rw micro cell and pore water salinity.
