<p id="Ancr1">The Statfjord Field is the largest producing oil field in Europe in terms of recoverable reserves. It is located in the Tampen Area of the North Sea, 200 km northwest of Bergen, Norway, straddling the border between the Norwegian and UK sectors, see Figure 1. The field is approximately 27 km long and 4 km wide, with a STOIIP (stock tank oil initially in place) of approximately 1 billion Sm3.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The Statfjord Field was discovered in 1973 and started production in 1979. It is developed with three concrete platforms, where each platform is a combined drilling and production unit. In addition, the Statfjord satellite fields (Statfjord Øst, Statfjord Nord and Sygna) and the Snorre Field are connected to the Statfjord Field facilities, as illustrated in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">It has a dip of approximately 6-7 degrees towards west-northwest. The East Flank consists of slump fault blocks generated by gravitational failure at the crest of the field. The East Flank is structurally and stratigraphically complex. It is heavily faulted with internal faults and small scale structures, which makes reservoir mapping challenging. Communication from the Main Field to the East Flank is generally good, with some restrictions as one moves to the east of the field. Most reservoirs are of excellent quality. Top structure and a cross-section of the field is illustrated in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Prior to depressurization start-up, the field has produced about 652 million Sm3 (4.1 billion bbl) of oil and 187 billion Sm3 of gas. Currently, the field is producing at an oil rate of approximately 5 300 Sm3/d and gas rate of about 11 million Sm3/d. Oil production history and water cut development prior to depressurization start up, is illustrated in Figure 4.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">In 2005 the SFLL project was sanctioned. This project consists of depressurization of the Brent Gp. and Statfjord Fm. reservoirs in order to liberate gas from remaining oil. The depressurization process is illustrated in Figure 5. It was expected that, as reservoir pressure falls below bubble point pressure, gas will be released from the remaining oil. The gas will then migrate towards the crest, from where it will be produced (Agaev, 2003; Aadland, 2001).</p><div id="link-5">

This is mainly due to in PDO no production has been assumed from SFA after 2012, while SFA is still in operation and is expected to produce until 2020.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">To monitor the onset of seabed subsidence at the Statfjord Field, installation of one precision Global Positioning Service (GPS) receiver on the SFA platform was done in June 2003 prior to the start of the SFLL project. To further enhance the understanding of the subsidence on the Statfjord Field, GPS antennas were installed on SFB and SFC platforms in March 2011. The total subsidence of the SFA platform after the GPS was installed (prior to start of depletion) is presented in Figure 9, which is in line with the subsidence prognosis made prior to SFLL. The current development does not call for any preventive actions.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr13">As illustrated in Figure 13, cumulative gas production vs cumulative reservoir pressure depletion rate was slightly higher than expected. This is not only due to gas mobility, but also due to more available wells and increased process capacities (prolonged life time for SFA). Gas mobility is regarded to be within estimated uncertainty ranges for relative permeabilities and critical gas saturation (Petersen, 2004). It should be also mentioned that actual production numbers are based on higher number of active wells vs PDO, and SFA still producing. In PDO, no gas production was assumed from SFA after 2012.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">Based on 10 years of depressurization experience in the Statfjord Field, it can be concluded that in most areas we have been very successful, whereas in others we could have done a better job. It is important to mention that mitigation actions have been taken underway based on subsurface behaviour, drilling progress, facility upgrades and other events. Summary of depressurization experience is illustrated in Figure 15.</p><div id="link-15">
