<p id="Ancr1">The main Gullfaks field lies in block 34/10 in the northern part of the Norwegian North Sea, approximately 180 km north west of Bergen and was developed with three large concrete production platforms. Gullfaks A and C are almost identical and are fully integrated platforms located in water depths of 135 and 217 m, respectively. Gullfaks B is an accommodation, drilling and water injection platform in 145 m of water. Figure 1 shows the relative location and infrastructure of the field.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">This is a back calculation of the mass of H2S in all three phases to a concentration in either total produced water or, alternatively, the fraction of injection water (in this case seawater) in the produced water. The method relies on good test data and a reliable partitioning calculator to calculate the mass of H2S in each phase. In order to relate the amount of H2S to the injection water fraction, an ion analysis, ideally carried out at the same time, is required to determine the amount of injected water in the produced water. Figure 2 shows the data input to the calculation workflow.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Examples of the double peaked souring development are shown in Figures 3 – 5. Graphs are presented showing oil, gas and water production – the water being divided into formation water (FW) and seawater (SW) fractions to indicate breakthrough of injected water. The souring index rises on initial breakthrough of injection water (SW) and then falls after a period of time. There is then seen a gradual rise in souring index – particularly noticeable in well C-8. The initial peak of souring varies from well to well, but seems to be a recurring feature of the measured data.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 6 shows a representation of the combined effect of a mixing and biofilm souring pattern, as envisaged by Ligthelm et al. (1991) and Sunde et al. (1993) respectively, and could provide one explanation of the observations from the Gullfaks field. An initial rise in souring associated with the initial breakthrough of injected seawater to the producing wells and supported by short chain organic acids or sparingly water soluble oil components from the formation water. This is followed by a decrease and then a gradual increase of the souring at a later time, which could be associated with H2S generation supported by biodegradation of oil components.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">The initial results of nitrate treatment appeared promising and the data published (Sunde et al., 2004) are often cited as a demonstration of the effectiveness of the mitigation method (Bronneberg and Heagler, 2015; Corrin et al, 2014; Kuijvenhoven et al, 2007; Voordouw et al, 2011). Based, however, on an understanding of the souring trend seen in the field and described in the previous section, it now seems, perhaps, more likely that the fall in measured H2S, as shown in Figure 7 is attributable to the rather unusual souring development pattern seen in the Gullfaks field.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Further support of this assertion is given by closer examination of measured data shown in Figure 8, which are absent from those presented in Figure 7, prior to start of nitrate injection, which indicates an already falling level of H2S. The original data were from selected wells and this extended data set is from the same set, but with an expanded time scale. The original results were expressed as mg H2S per litre of produced water, whilst the updated information is given as mg H2S per litre of produced injection water, hence the different scales on the y-axes.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">In addition to the already falling trend in souring, an examination of interwell tracer measurements showed that typical breakthrough times of three to four years were recorded for the wells included in this data set. It is unlikely, therefore that the observed effect is influenced by breakthrough of nitrate treated injection water as it would not have reached the producing wells in that relatively short period of time. This is demonstrated in the measurements from well B-25 where start of nitrate injection in the injection water and the expected time to an observed effect (based on tracer data) are presented in Figure 9.</p><div id="link-9">
