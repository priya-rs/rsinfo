<p id="Ancr1">Skjold is a naturally fractured chalk reservoir located in the Central Graben within the Danish sector of the North Sea (see Fig. 1). Maersk Oil discovered the field in 1977 and commenced production in 1982 from the fractured chalk formation draped over a salt diapir. Oil density is medium (30° API); oil viscosity is low (0.93 cp). Reservoir depth is at between 4630-6390ft TVDSS. The productive formations of the field consist of Ekofisk, Tor and Hod chalk, which is thinned on the crest (see Fig. 2). Diagenetic processes (Jensenius, 1988) and a high number of small-scale faults control the reservoir properties. Reservoir properties in the crest are favourable with effective permeability up to several Darcy. Reservoir performance is dominated by fracture flow. The thinner crest exhibits most intense fracturing, while thicker flanks are much less fractured with typical matrix permeability of 1-5 millidarcy (mD).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">It soon became apparent, however, that the injected water preferentially sweeps through the fracture systems in Skjold, bypassing much of the oil volume contained within thicker, relatively less fractured flank areas (Thomasen, 1994). As a consequence, production and injection wells which were drilled during the 1990s and early 2000s were focused specifically into the less fractured flank areas of the field. 23 producers and 11 injectors had been drilled by 2004. At this point in time the field was considered to be well developed (see Fig. 3) and no drilling has been carried out on Skjold since then.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Fluids are currently recovered using 17 producer wells to a small wellhead platform complex (130ft water depth). They are then exported via 2 parallel multiphase pipelines to the larger Gorm platform complex some 11km away for processing and export. Water injection to the 8 active water injectors and lift gas is also supplied from Gorm. Total oil production to date is around 300 million stb, or 38% of the original oil-in-place of 790 million stb. This appears to be a relatively high recovery factor when compared to other fractured oilfields globally (Allan, 2003). Current field oil production rate is around 11,000stb/d, water cut about 87% (see Fig. 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">In 2014 a coiled tubing production logging and water shut off operation was executed successfully, leveraging the insights acquired from the grounding studies: Structural attributes extracted from seismic data (Jibrin, 2014) had highlighted potential faults in the Western area of the Skjold reservoir. More heavily fractured areas often exist around fault zones and hence it was proposed that these attributes represented the location of potential conductive zones and dominating fluid corridors in the Western area of the field (see Fig. 5). This concept was supported by the observed well production history which had indicated significant well interference. Coiled tubing data acquisition in 2014 subsequently confirmed the interpreted fluid corridors, zones in two wells were closed, water production was reduced and oil production increased in these wells.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Heavily fractured and highly conductive zones exist; fracture flow dominates. Also, uncertainty in matrix properties is orders of magnitude lower than uncertainty in fracture properties. Consequently, a key model variable which required adjustment during dynamic model history matching was the fracture permeability, with contrasts spanning many orders of magnitude in the history matched model (see Fig. 6). Full back-loop updates were applied to arrive at a geologically viable model realisation that matches dynamic data as close as possible. The main Skjold production zone has been the Tor with current recovery factor estimated at up to 42%. Lowest recovery factor was computed for the Ekofisk at less than 30%.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">A forecast for Skjold without water injection has been generated using the new dynamic model (see Fig. 7), to futher develop conceptual understanding as well as illustrate approximately what the impact might be on field production rates. Based on these screening simulation results, it appears that there could potentially be value associated with shutting in the water injection several years prior to final Skjold COP date.</p><div id="link-7">
