<p id="Ancr3">Laboratory and pilot tests continued (Meyer). This technique was first tested on a large scale in the 1970's in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. The first two large-scale projects consisted of the SACROC flood in Scurry County, Texas, implemented in January of 1972, and the North Crossett flood in Crane and Upton Counties, Texas, initiated in April 1972. Over the next five to ten years, the petroleum industry was able to conclude that incremental oil could indeed be produced by injecting CO2 into the reservoir and the number of CO2flood projects began to grow (Melzer et al, 2012) as shown in Figures 1. This kind of growth means that the technique is very successful in the U.S.</p><div id="link-1">

The map of this reservoir can be seen in Figure 1A and other production data are presented in Figures 1B and 1C. The second reservoir is a black oil reservoir that was initially under saturated and was also produced using four wells. The reservoir pressure trend suggests that the system is under partial water drive and fluid expansion drive mechanisms; there is an indication of pore volume compressibility but this is relatively small compared to the other two drive mechanisms.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr13">The recovery factor results of the simulation work are presented in Figures 4A to 4C. Figure 4A shows that the recovery factor for the reference case under full water drive is 63% while the recovery factor for water injection, CO2injection and CO2 with WAG were each 67%. It is clear from this result that the recovery factor from EOR using CO2 is not very significant probably because strong water drive is efficient in displacing oil from formations hence the high recovery efficiency even from the reference case. Figure 4B which is for the partial water drive supported by fluid expansion gave a recovery factor of 40% for the reference case which is expected since strong water drive improves oil recovery better than a weak aquifer.</p><div id="link-11">
