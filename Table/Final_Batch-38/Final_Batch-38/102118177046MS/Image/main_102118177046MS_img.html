<p id="Ancr3">We consider a simple 2D example to clarify these points. Let us analyze an heterogenous 2D small model with five spot type of pattern, like the one shown in Figure 1. This layer is assumed to start at irreducible water saturation and flooded by four injectors, I1 to I4. Figure 2 displays the evolution of the saturation profile after 23 months of injection. The distorted breakthrough travels to the producers and eventually a situation like the one depicted in Figure 3 is obtained, where the reservoir has high mean water saturation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The injection profile in this example is modified randomly between certain levels during the numerical experiment. In this case the boundary condition at the producers is negligible bottom hole pressure, which resembles that of an optimally operated well. Production data is generated solving the fluid motion with Schlumberger Eclipse (black oil) on a fine grid. Now, if a simple CRM model [1] is fitted to this example, one obtains the comparison shown in Figure 4. In this Figure we show the history matched data toghether with predicted rates.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 6 shows a typical output of the anlysis, namely a map of the connectivities in the last period of time (only the most representative values, with a threshold based on duration of the pair, are shown here). In this Figure we plot an arrow of size proportional to the mean associated rate (connectivity times injection) and color depicting the error range. Thus, it easy to identify the main problems in the field by visual inspection.</p><div id="link-6">

Both indicators yield to the conclusion that there exists a high perm type of connection between them. Consistently the numerical analysis highlights this well as 46th in the list.
