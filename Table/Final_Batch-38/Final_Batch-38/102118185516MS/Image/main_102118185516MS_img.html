<p id="Ancr6">The surge in oil prices in the early 80‘s encouraged adapting new completion strategies to promote oil and sand production: sand control devices were no longer installed downhole and wellbore perforations were designed to be of a larger diameter. Canadian experiences and practices were soon replicated in Venezuela, where heavy oil deposits located in the Orinoco Heavy Oil Belt(HOB) are of similar characteristics. Fig.1 shows the location of the main CHOPS assets in Canada and Venezuela. Table 1 compares the typical reservoir properties of UCSS heavy oil deposits in Saskatchewan and the Orinoco HBO.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">Oil rate tends to increase gradually over a period of several months to a peak value of 20 – 40 m3/day, and after which, it gradually decreases to uneconomical in the range of 2 – 3 m3/day (Dusseault 2002). Fig. 2 shows the typical production trend of a well producing under CHOPS. This particular trend is known as CHOPS signature, due to the fact that the majority of wells follow this behavior. Note that three production cycles, separated by workovers, can be identified as attempts to promote more sand influx and to boost oil production.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr12">The model is initialized to approximate the conditions at the end of a typical CHOPS operation. Assuming a typical recovery factor of approximately 12% at the end of CHOPS (Soh 2016), the fluid saturations are then explicitlyassigned in such a way that the oil saturation in the matrix would gradually decrease with proximity to the depleted wormholes (typically referred to as the depletion envelop). Fig. 7 illustrates the initial oil saturation distribution corresponding to a one of the realizations for post-CHOPS modeling. An initial pressure of 1000–2000 kPa is commonly observed in the field.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr18">These values are also plotted in Fig. 13. It is observed that as wormhole intensity increases, fracture dispersivity also increases. This reflects the additional mixing as a result of variation in flow paths among the wormholes. On the other hand, as wormhole intensity increases, the contribution to solvent transport from matrix dispersion is less prominent, since less matrix volume is remaining in a bulk grid block. Therefore, a decreasing trend in matrix dispersivity with wormhole intensity is observed.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr19">One of the main challenges in reservoir simulation is achieving a balance between accuracy and computational cost. This practical approach, involving a dual-permeability model, can offer the opportunity to reduce computational effort drastically as shown in Fig. 14. Reliable and efficient field-scale simulations with multiple well patterns can be performed byaccounting for the contribution of sub-scale heterogeneities (wormhole configurations)in the transport and mixing of solvent and heavy oil in post-CHOPS applications.</p><div id="link-14">
