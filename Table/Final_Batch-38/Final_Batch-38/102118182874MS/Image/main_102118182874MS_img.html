<p id="Ancr1">As such field development was divided into several stages including Early Production Scheme (EPS), Phase I and Phase III, Transition Zone Development, Infill Development and North Development. Figure 1 shows th different phases within field U. Each development phase addresses a specific area in the reservoir. EPS is the initial development before full field injection started. The EPS started in the early 1990s and continued until 2005 when Phase I was started as well as full field injection.</p><div id="link-1">

The distribution of structural uncertainty is shown in Figure 2. As the reservoir play structure is an anticline, with the reservoir structure dipping more towards the flank. Also from sensitivity analysis as can be seen in Figure 3 in the tornado plot, structural uncertainty has the highest impact on STOIIP i.e. between +/- 12% of STOIIP.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Oil formation volume factor (Bo) uncertainty varies from 1.39 to 1.9. Due to the complexity of Field U fluid properties, there is no clear relationship between Bo and depth as can be seen from Figure 4. There is both a lateral and vertical variation of Bo across field U. As a result of this complex variation, it is sometimes observed that at similar depths, the fluid property such as Bo varies greatly. The uncertainty in terms of Bo variation is given in Figure 5 per well in Field U. The tornado plot in Figure 3 shows the impact of Bo, and that Bo has the second most significant effect on the STOIIP. This impact was quantified to range between -5% and 8% on the STOIIP.</p><div id="link-4">

Both types of data were used in order to quality check each form of data against one another. In cases where there are large differences between the OWC calculated from log and cores, the respective well data was excluded as outliners. The tornado plot in Figure 3 shows that OWC has third most significant impact on the STOIIP, with a minimum impact of -6% and a maximum of 7% on STOIIP.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">The height above free water level (HAFWL) or saturation height function (SHF) uncertainty varies between +/- 15ft. This variation is a function of the reservoir properties, the less the reservoir quality in terms of porosity for example, the higher change in capillary pressure hence higher HAFWL/FWL. The HAFWL/SHF was defined based on two wells (Well 18 and Well 49) where, Special Core Analysis were conducted including mercury injection capillary pressure (MICP) measurements. Figure 7 shows the variation on HAFWL as defined from Well 18 and Well 49. The impact of HAFWL is shown in Figure 3 and as can be seen varies for the minimum of -4% to 2% change in STOIIP.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">The porosity uncertainty shows the least impact on STOIIP as can be seen from Figure 3. i.e. -1% to 2%change in STOIIP. The reason for this parameter having the least impact is based on the fact that most of the wells where data was arcquired always collected porosity. As a result, the porosity distribution between the wells, is well understood and can be predicted within reason. The distribution between wells is shown in Figure 8. As can be seen porosity varies between 25%pu &amp; 5%pu.</p><div id="link-8">

As a result of the integration of SCAL from both wells, a total of 5 RRT were defined. Each RRT was assigned its respectively relative permeability and capillary pressure based on measured data in the laboratory. Sensitivity on RRT involves varying the RRT from the worst to best RRT, its respectively relative permeability and capillary pressure and measuring its effect on the recovery.

In order to mimic the communication between gas cap and the oil zone, transimissiblity was varied and its effect on recovery quantified. The gas cap effect on the recovery is shown in Figure 10. As can be seen the effect varies from 0% to 4%. The gas cap and oil in the reservoir is shown in the ternary plot on Figure 11.</p><div id="link-11">

In the crest the dense is less developed however, the dense in the flank is more developed. As such sensitivity was conducted by varying the dense development in form of transmissibility. As can be seen from Figure 10, variation of the dense development between subzones has a minimum impact on recovery factor of 0% and a maximum of 4%.

As such sensitivity was conducted by varying the communication between the faults. Faults transmissibility was varied between fully sealing, partial sealing and fully open.

<p id="Ancr16">The connected pore volume per well and production data was used in calculating the remaining oil per well. Equation 1 shows the formula used in calculating this remaining oil per well. The distribution of remaining oil per well in Figure 16 shows that the uncertainty per well to deliver the plan production is within reason, as most of the wells have oil remaining per well enough to meet expected mandate. Also the well level uncertainty analysis allowed for improved well placement strategy, as infill wells can be planned for locations, where the remaining oil per well is high compared to relative wells in the area.</p><div id="link-16">
