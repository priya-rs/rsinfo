Figure 1 shows an overview of the Åsgard area. The fields were developed with two production units: Åsgard A as floating production, storage and off-loading (FPSO) unit and Åsgard B as a semi-submersible platform.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Gas is transferred from Åsgard A to Åsgard B, depending on Åsgard A compressor capacities. The transferred gas together with produced gas from Åsgard B is exported to Gassco processing plant in Karst0. The remained gas from Åsgard A is reinjected into Smørbukk and Smørbukk Sør fields. Åsgard A FPSO is used for storing produced hydrocarbon and offloading. Åsgard produced crude oil and condensate are mixed to form a light oil called Åsgard blend. In this paper, Åsgard blend oil is called ‘oil’, for simplicity. Figure 2 shows schematic of Asagrd A and Asagrd B production units with possibility of gas injection from Åsgard A into Smørbukk and Smørbukk Sør fields.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">As discussed before, internal gas disposition is studied for Smørbukk (SMB) and Smørbukk Sør (SMS) fields, utilizing black oil standalone simulation models to estimate gas injection efficiency (GIF) for each injector. Figure 4 shows the cross plot of delta cumulative produced oil versus cumulative injected gas at different injection rates for Smørbukk field injectors as an example. The figure shows that the average injection efficiencies of SMB Inj. Well # 1 and SMB Inj. Well # 2 are approximately double of SMB Inj. Well # 3; hereby SMB Inj. Well # 1 and SMB Inj. Well # 2 have higher priority for injection compare to SMB Inj. Well # 3.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The gas injection efficiency of injectors also examined over time. Figure 5 illustrates the gas injection efficiency development of Smørbukk Sør injectors over time from 2014 to 2017. The main recovery mechanism of gas injection in Smørbukk Sør field is condensate vaporization. The gas injection also mitigates water coning from aquifer since the production wells are horizontal or highly deviated and placed near water oil contact. Predicting accurate water development over time (which strongly affects the lifetime of Smørbukk Sør producers) is the main challenge by reservoir simulations model.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Another approach for understanding if the production wells are affected by reducing or increasing gas injection, is the analysis of the cross plot of well gas production rate versus well cumulative gas production. This is shown for SMB Prod. Well #2 and SMS Prod. Well #2, as an example, in Figure 7. The production from SMB Prod. Well #2 is enhanced due to pressure support and vaporization after resumption of the gas injection in Smørbukk field and production from SMS Prod. Well #2 is decreased more severely due to reduced gas injection in the Garn Formation of Smørbukk Sør field.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">The tracer analysis provides an understanding of communication between injectors and producers and is a good tool to estimate how long does the tracer (and injected gas) needs for the breakthrough; however tracer analysis in Åsgard is quite challenging since the produced gas containing all types of tracers is reinjected again. For example the used tracer for a specific formation and a well in Smørbukk field will be observed in some wells in Smørbukk Sør field or the used tracer for Ile and Tilje injector will be detected in Garn producers. Through interpretation and filtering of recycled tracers based on tracer concentration are necessary prior to establishing the injector and producer communication maps as it is shown in Figure 8.</p><div id="link-8">
