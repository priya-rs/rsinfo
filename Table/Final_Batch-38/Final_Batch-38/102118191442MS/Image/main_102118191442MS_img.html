<p id="Ancr1">By definition, a heat map is a 2D representation of data in a format of varying colors. In our study, we use the density of any object related to a hydraulic fracture in a color scale mapped over a 2D canvas. A hydraulic fracture object could be any discrete mapping of properties such as hydraulic fracture permeability, proppant distribution, or the hydraulic fracture footprint itself. The heat map of a property along the wellbore is created by summing the property values with reference to the wellbore in the I, J, or K direction (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Well completion practices in Reagan County alone have varied. Comparing the reported completion data from IHS, when we looked at the amount of proppant pumped per gallon of fracturing fluid, the range of variation for operators landing their wellbore in the Wolfcamp ranges from 0.8 lbm/gal to 1.2 lbm/gal (Fig. 3), and the amount of proppant pumped per perforated interval ranges from 1,000 lbm/ft to 2,000 lbm/ft. This suggests that the subsurface heterogeneity in the county has driven the operators to choose different treatment designs depending on where they operate.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Fig. 4 depicts the overall workflow for the well completion optimization developed during this study. The process starts with building the geocellular model, which comprises a description of the reservoir properties, geomechanical properties, and natural fracture network model. To build a robust geocellular model, geology and geophysical information derived from seismic data is incorporated apart from the well logs and their interpretation. Dipole sonic logs acquired from pilot wellbores are used to create the geomechanical property distribution in the model.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Because hydraulic fractures interact mechanically with natural fractures present in the unconventional reservoirs, the geometry created looks significantly different from the conventional notion of bi-winged planar fracture geometry. It is thought that as the hydraulic fracture interacts with the natural fracture, there are possibly three options for propagation (Fig. 7): cross the natural fracture, dilate the natural fracture and propagate in the direction of the natural fracture, or dilate and then cross the fracture.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">An example for the hydraulic fracture geometry in our study is shown in Fig. 8. It can be seen that, depending on the natural fracture intensity, the hydraulic fractures are longer at instances of sparse distributed fracture network (DFN) and shorter at instances of dense DFN. Microseismic data acquired on numerous instances across various wells stimulated in the region also confirm the heterogeneity of the reservoir and hydraulic fracture growth because the stage-by-stage microseismic events show variation in their footprint as an independent confirmation.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">As part of the workflow, a quick production data analysis through the planar and simple model is ascertained to create a better understanding of reservoir properties and effective fracture geometries. When the geological model is ready, a bi-winged planar fracture is used to represent hydraulic fractures as an initial estimate. As shown in Fig. 9, the red cells represent higher-conductivity fractures (occupied by larger proppants), purple cells represent lower-conductivity fractures (occupied by smaller proppants), and green cells represent unpropped microfractures.</p><div id="link-9">

The major difference between the slickwater and hybrid treatment is the total fluid volume pumped; slickwater treatments, because of the low viscosity, require more fluid due to a conservative proppant concentration to pump the same proppant volume. Fig. 18 shows the heat maps for slickwater and hybrid treatments at different proppant per lateral foot and cluster spacing.

<p id="Ancr19">Production forecasting using a history matched and calibrated model was performed on all the completion design sensitivities using numerical analysis to quantify the production performance and determine the main production drivers. Fig. 19 shows the relative oil production performance compared to the base case of 1,800 lbm/ft at 54-ft cluster spacing and five clusters per stage. Increase in oil production was found to be mainly driven by increasing pounds per lateral foot and decreasing cluster spacing.</p><div id="link-19">

This allowed a greater number of wells to be drilled in the spacing unit since the wells had shown greater near-wellbore density of hydraulic fractures.

<p id="Ancr34">This enabled shortening the time from concept to field implementation and enabled continual optimization of completions designs over the last few years. An independent measurement such as microseismic data and its intensity heat map reveals that increasing the proppant loading and decreasing the cluster spacing makes the hydraulic fracture footprint denser as well as more effective near the wellbore (Fig. 34). This further allows improving recovery per wellbore and at the same time allows placing more wells per pad.</p><div id="link-34">
