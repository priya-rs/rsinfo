<p id="Ancr1">Fig. 1 shows the location of wells with cased-hole saturation logs which is focusing at western area where Well-A is to be drilled. Cased-hole saturation logging was executed at Well-01 and Well-02 in 2015; at Well-03, Well-04 and Well-05 in 2016. Results of 2015/16 cased-hole logs were compared with the fluid contacts evaluated from cased-hole logs acquired at Well-06 in 2009. These wells were drilled during the early phases of field development whereby Well-01 and Well-02 were drilled in 1975 whereas Well-03, Well-04, Well-05 and Well-06 were drilled in 1994-1995.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Fig. 2 illustrates the fluid contact movements in both M and N reservoirs from the original fluid column evaluated when the wells were drilled to recent years post-production contacts based on cased-hole logging. The consolidated results from surveillance activities clearly show that the oil rim at the eastern structure has moved into gas cap, with uneven thickness of oil columns. Fluid contact movement analysed from cased-hole logs is in-line with the reservoir modeling understanding that the aquifer strength on the western structure is weaker than that of eastern side, in which the oil rim still remains below the original gas-oil-contact.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Fig. 3 shows the proposed new target of Well-A in M reservoir which is ~900ft away from Well-D. The well placement optimization was performed with similar FDP redevelopment assumptions. The final new target location of Well-A has approximately similar oil production potential compared to workover option of Well-D. Since the new target location is closer to the crest and is estimated to be invaded by the gas cap, the producing zone will be limited to lower M reservoir subunit.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The estimated initial oil production rate of Well-A is 1,215 STB/D. The production rate is estimated to decline after 4 years of production. GOR increases sharply in the first five years of production, then stays mostly plateau for the remaining production life. As a result of Well-A up dip location, water breaks through at a later time. Fig. 4 shows the comparison of Well-A and Well-D production forecasts.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Due to the dynamic movement of fluid contacts in M reservoir, main uncertainties on oil rim thickness and oil rim location are incorporated into Well-A drilling decision tree as shown in Fig. 5 to ensure well deliverability as planned. Further optimization of Well-A is to be calibrated with Well-C result during the drilling campaign. In the scenario of oil rim thickness as per expected but location of the oil rim is either shifted shallower or deeper, then Well-A target will be adjusted up dip or down dip based on Well-C result. However, if oil rim thickness is below the identified threshold, then a further decision should be made.</p><div id="link-5">
