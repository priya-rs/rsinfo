<p id="Ancr2">The Vostochno-Messoyakhskoe field is the northernmost active continental field in the Russian Federation (Fig. 1). This field is located 250 km from the Arctic Circle, in the arctic climatic zone. Full production drilling only began in 2015 because of the field's geological complexity and lack of transportation structure. Weather conditions, such as strong winds and extremely low temperatures, can be hazardous to personnel and equipment. Additionally, this oil field has permafrost zones (400m from the surface) and low formation temperatures at the production zone. Also, because of permafrost zones, there is a high risk of thawing the wellhead formation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Production is further complicated by a gas layer at 720 to 820m true vertical depth (TVD) and high formation pore pressure. This can make the cement operations with the production casings difficult. While the TVD of the casing landing is not relatively deep, the measured depth (MD) in extended reach drilling (ERD) wells is significant (Fig. 2). ERD wells can challenge cement displacement efficiency (Sabins, 1990). Mud removal efficiency may not be enough to create a high-quality cement barrier and isolate formations from gas migration.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">To address these challenges, computer modeling of cementing operations was performed with different displacement rates (fast and low) to determine the most effective rate for mud displacement using spacers and cements (Parker, 1965). By the assumption that during low-rate displacement by gravitational force and a large density difference, spacers and cements "fall down" and provide better cement placement at the bottom narrow space of the horizontal section (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Pressure test failure of the annular space between casings is the main issue in this field. Industrial experimental results show the effectiveness of a low-rate displacement method. The results of performed cement jobs were better, particularly in the annular space between casings (Fig. 4). Better cement bonding results in the space between casings can potentially decrease risks of failure pressure tests and extend the life of wells.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Simulated cementing operations with 7-in. and 6.6-in production casing in the Vostochno-Messoyakhskoe field showed positive results (Fig. 5). Completed jobs CBL results in the production and surface casing intervals were better when using low-rate displacement compared to using a high rate. However, deviation from the expected pressure during low-rate displacement was observed during the operations on some wells. The final displacement pressure was much higher than modeled (Fig. 6). Because hydraulic packers (and other hydraulic equipment) can activate earlier during displacement, high pressure could affect the success of the operation.</p><div id="link-5">

Because hydraulic packers (and other hydraulic equipment) can activate earlier during displacement, high pressure could affect the success of the operation. Because of these unexpected results, after the jobs, repeated rheology tests were performed in a laboratory using cement samples from the field and no deviations were identified. The results were the same as pilot tests before the jobs (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">
