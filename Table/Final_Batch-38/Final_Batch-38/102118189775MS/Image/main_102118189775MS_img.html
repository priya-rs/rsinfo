<p id="Ancr1">Each horizontal well pair consists of an injector about 5 m directly above and parallel to a producer, each being of identical horizontal length of about 850m. Injected steam heats the bitumen to reduce its viscosity and creates a steam chamber that grows primarily in the vertical and horizontal direction, as shown in Figure 1 (Butler 1997). The producer is placed near the bottom of the reservoir and serves to remove liquids (oil and water) that gravity drain from the steam chamber to form a liquid “sump”.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Every production well was equipped with either fiber optic distributed temperature sensing (DTS) or the LxData 60-point fiber optic array system, assembled within 31.75mm (1-1/4in) coiled tubing. The instrumented coiled tubing string is conveyed to the toe of the producer well through an 88.9mm (3-1/2in) utility string. A pressure and temperature sensor, and a bubble tube are installed with the production string above the pump to provide the pressure input for calculating the saturated temperature of the water phase. The standard completion schematic in the MacKay River project is depicted in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The dual string in the injector is intended to distribute the steam better along the horizontal section of the wellbore and thereby reduce the possibility of short-circuiting the steam into the producer well. Ideally, a steam chamber would grow uniformly along the horizontal length of the wellpair as a result of this technique. However, there is virtually no flow restriction along the liner, nor between the liner slots and the reservoir. Experience indicates that steam chamber growth is typically uneven along the wellbore, primarily due to reservoir heterogeneities, as illustrated in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">For sand control, the MeshRite compressed stainless-steel wool depth filter technology, developed (Toma et al, SPE 15057) specifically for the oilsands, was selected because of 1) high open flow area (40%), 2) high plugging resistance, 3) mechanical robustness, and 4) insensitivity to particle size distribution (PSD) variations. (See Woiceshyn et al, SPE 139360). Figure 4 presents the design of the ICD liner that was installed in the open hole.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Figure 5 illustrates the ICD well completion where ICDs are included only in the producer for the purpose of regulating the toe-to-heel influx. Also shown are PSDs of relevant sands from the field which indicate significant variation as well as the presence of fines. Consequently, the MeshRite sand control media (Woiceshyn et al, 2010) was selected because, among other things, of its insensitivity to PSD variations and high fines content.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 6 shows the Mackay River field development. Eight pads, each consisting of 4 to 6 well pairs, 42 well pairs in total, were approved for drilling starting in Q3 2012. Based on the promising results of the reservoir simulations, two candidates were selected for trial ICD wells, AC01 and AD02. AC01 on AC Pad has comparable geology to the rest of the wellpairs in the same pad. AD01 and AD02 have slightly higher water saturations between the producer and injector when compared to the rest of the AD wells.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">MacKay River SAGD production started Q2 2017 (i.e., “startup” when producers were converted to production after the circulation period) using artificial lift. All 4 well pairs were started within several days of each other. Figure 7 shows cumulative liquid (“emulsion”) produced vs time since startup for AC wells. After 142 days on production, the ICD well (AC01) produced in average 59% more liquid, respectively, than the Slotted Liner (SL) wells AC02, AC03 and AC04. The slope of the curve after 142 days is much higher for the ICD well.</p><div id="link-7">
