<anchoringText id="Ancr3">There are 9 injectors and 20 producers in the model with all but one injection well being vertical. A commercial compositional simulator (CMG, 2015) was used for the reservoir simulations. Nine pseudo-components were used to describe the system: N2, CO2, C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6-C7, and C8+. Figure 1 is an illustration of the horizontal permeability field with the locations of the injection and production wells marked.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">The maximum number of WAG cycles is set to 15 because of the operator suggested strategy of 30 day water injection and 90 day CO2 injection phases. The time control method is allowed to eliminate a number of half cycles, but was not allowed to add cycles. All of the optimization parameters are kept the same (including the initial seed) and the producer BHPs are optimized during the process as well in all three cases. The results, as summarized in Table 1 and Figure 2, illustrate that the use of both rate and time controls for the injectors results in a higher objective function value by 13% when compared to rate control only. Contributing to the higher objective function (NPV), more oil is produced and less CO2 and water are injected when time controls were used.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">Although the injection rate of CO2 is increased substantially at the beginning of the optimization run with rate control only, as shown in Figure 3, the case with rate and time controls is more effectively able to recover oil, reduce the amount of CO2 produced and reduce the amount of injected CO2. This is due to the higher degree of controllability obtained through the addition of switching time as a control option. Figure 3 to Figure 5 show that the optimized injection wells for this field undergo different types of strategies that ignore traditional WAG constraints (e.g. a fixed WAG ratio) in order to achieve an optimal NPV.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">It should be noted that the time-and-rate strategy has not fully converged to a solution at the end of 20 iterations and it is possible that the optimal strategy could have had fewer WAG cycles as some of the water injection cycles are very short (less than 15 days). The solution for this case may take longer to converge as there are more controls to consider and some of them are conflicting (cycle length and injection rates are essentially coupled). The production BHP solutions were very similar or all three cases (onle slight deviations). Figure 6 is the producer BHPs for the rate and time injection control case.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">Figure 7 shows snapshots of oil saturation for both the reference case and the optimized rate-and-time case. It can be seen increased oil saturations appear after 1 year which can be attributed to oil swelling caused by achieving miscible conditions in a shorter amount of time for the injection rates-and-time optimization case than with the base case strategy. At the end of the life-cycle period (1800 days) the amount of remaining oil is also much less for the optimized case in comparison with the base case proposed by the operator.</anchoringText>
