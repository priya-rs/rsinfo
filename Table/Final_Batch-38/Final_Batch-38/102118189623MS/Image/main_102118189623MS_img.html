<p id="Ancr7">The bean-up guide provided was adhered to as much as operations allowed. During the flowback of the completion fluids, topside valves upstream of the test separator were continuously blocked by completion fluid and resolving this issue slowed the bean-up rate during the clean-up period. Also, the drawdowns experienced during the clean-up periods were not in line with expectations based on mobility data acquired while drilling the reservoir section of the well. Figure 3 shows data acquired during the A-1H clean-up period.</p><div id="link-3">

The drawdown rate during the main flow period is estimated at circa 2.3 bar/hr. Unlike A-2H, although the required drawdown to produce at maximum rate is higher (27 bar for A-4H versus 17 bar for A-2H), the rate of decline in FBHP is negligible which could indicate that A-4H is connected to more reservoir volumes.

<p id="Ancr29">Calculated pressure and temperature at DHPT gauge depth (3,866 m MD) are plotted in Figure 25 to compare against measured data points. It shows simulation results capture the trends of downhole pressure and temperature changes. Discrepancy in pressure is observed from 0 to 0.8 hours and is explained due to the ‘stiff’ full liquid system at initial conditions. A better match was achieved once formation fluid begins flowing into wellbore, thus small simulation time steps are crucial to improve the model accuracy.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr30">A sensitivity study was performed to acquire the representative choke diameter to better capture the pressure loss due to the flow restriction. As shown in Figure 26, calculated BHP matches the measured BHP quite well for most of the clean-up, except for the discrepancy observed between 4 to 5 hours. The noticeable increased downhole pressure measurements were due to plugging of the choke. During this period, calculated BHP is lower than measured data as the choke size in the model doesn’t reflect this plugging incident.</p><div id="link-26">

<p id="Ancr33">Figure 29 shows history matching results for BHP and liquid flowrates of A-2H. The flowrate calculation prior to the emergency shut-in matches with measured data reasonably well, except there is a gap between 3.2 and 4.25 hours where no flowrate records are available, thus no comparison was made. However, simulation results show the expected response with respect to the rig valve ramp up from 20/64th inch to 32/64th inch and subsequent choke-back to 24/64th inch during this period.</p><div id="link-29">

<p id="Ancr34">During the shut-in, calculated BHP agrees with gauge measurement in general, although discrepancies exist at the beginning of the shut-in; measured BHP shows a gradual increase before reaching equilibrium whereas simulation established the static BHP much faster. Again, this can be explained by the lack of a near wellbore model coupled to the simulator. Additionally, Figure 30 shows that most of the NaBr and LSOBM were cleaned up before the shut-in, which verifies the field records.</p><div id="link-30">
