<p id="Ancr2">Figure 1 shows the relative location of the Milne Point unit and extent of the Ugnu reservoir. In the limited period of production, both the wells produced around 20%of sand cut with oil rates higher than theoretically calculated from the given horizontal sections. Further production was however hindered since significant technological and investment challenges did not allow the operators to maintain economic flow rates. As a result, the pilot facility is under a shutdown awaiting further development.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Ugnu reservoirs hold the most viscous oils among the other North Slope reserves. Well A produced oil with a live oil viscosity of 5800 cp. As shown in Figure 2, the native fluid properties were matched by fitting the model predicted fluid properties with the experimental data using Peng-Robinson8 equation of state. To reduce the simulation time and required system memory, the C7+ fractions were split into 200 pseudo components and then lumped into six hypothetical components of equivalent PVT properties.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The refined grid blocks had the dimensions of 10' × 10' × 1'. A 39.41% change in porosity in the refined grid blocks that represented the wormhole channel, corresponded to 39.41 ft3 of sand removal from each block. As the wormhole channel propagates with the production, it was important to input the wormhole pattern in steps. Therefore, as shown in Figure 5, the sand production from the well was divided into 4 time periods. The extent of the wormhole channel growth was determined by the sand produced in the particular time period. More precisely, the number of grid blocks to be converted into a wormhole were equivalent to the amount of sand produced for the given time period.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">To achieve the best history match, relative permeability, absolute permeability of wormhole channels and non-equilibrium reaction rate were further fine-tuned. The rate of reaction was set to 2.88E-7 moles/day/ft3. The absolute permeability of wormholes was increased to 3500 mD. Gas relative permeability was suppressed to reduce the gas production. Figure 7 shows a reasonable history match between the field production of oil, gas and water matched with the simulation results for well A.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">Water flooding is the conventional enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method employed in the North Slope and which is further aided by availability of low salinity water from Prince Creek aquifer, making water flooding an inexpensive and convenient option. Figure 9 depicts the plot of oil recovery factor versus time obtained upon flooding the reservoir with water through the injection well B. A 50 years of water flooding simulation resulted in a little more than 12% of heavy oil recovery.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">The effect of viscous fingering can be observed by analyzing the fractional flow of water inside the reservoir. Higher fractional flow of water indicated higher bypass of oil in the wormhole channels. Figure 10 depicts the reservoir with transparent grids at different time steps. It can be observed that the fractional flow (fw) of water near the wormhole zone around the perforations in well A is higher than the surrounding reservoir. The reservoir layers with higher water saturation experienced earlier breakthrough of injected water. Injection constraints of maximum reservoir pressure of 1700 psi and maximum injection rate of 5000 bbl/d were applied.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">A basic job design was considered to carry out the simulations for polymer selection that included a pre-flush with water for one year followed by injecting polymer for the next one year and subsequently followed by water flood to provide a drive to the polymer solution. A preflush of water conditions the reservoir for subsequent EOR. Since the water from Prince creek aquifer has very low salinity, a preflush with water from that source will prevent the salinity effects on the polymer solution. Well B was used as an injection well. Injection constraints of maximum reservoir pressure of 1700 psi and maximum injection rate of 5000 bbl/d were applied. Figure 11 illustrates a plot between the oil recovery factor versus percentage of pore volumes injected. It is interesting to note that to obtain a particular recovery value, higher pore volumes of water flood was required as compared to the polymer flood.</p><div id="link-11">

The horizontal legs of both the wells are placed approximately 1700 feet apart. An injection well with same trajectory as well A was added at the mid point of both wells. Polymer injection was again carried out with the optimized design and resulted in oil recovery of ~47%after producing from well A. Further investigation was not carried out with this configuration and can be considered for a future research scope.
