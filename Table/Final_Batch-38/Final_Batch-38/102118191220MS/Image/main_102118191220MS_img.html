<p id="Ancr2">The data from BP's Statistical report (2017) shows that the average oil production of Trinidad and Tobago is steadily declining. This trend is even more alarming when the data is compared to the data obtained from Boodlal et al. in their paper entitled "Trinidad and Tobago's CO2 Inventory and Techno-economic Evaluation of Carbon Capture Options for Emission Mitigation". This paper shows that the CO2 emissions over the past ten years in Trinidad is rapidly increasing which is a direct cause of global warming. A summary of their results is seen in Figure 1 &amp; 2.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">In this paper each of the factors are examined and applied to a hypothetical field located in the Southern Basin of Trinidad. The average reservoir properties of oil reservoirs from this basin was used with an analog field and formation to conduct a CO2 EOR study. The approximate location of fields that has similar properties to the analogue field is seen figure 3. These are mature fields and are producing from the Upper Cruse to Forest Sands. The block reservoir was modelled, and CO2 injection was simulated using CMG. The result of the simulation was then compared to the proposed operational factors and an economic analysis was performed.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">In Figure 4 B immiscible displacement occurs, even though the mixture never reaches the critical point, the mixture moves toward the lighter components from C7+ closer to the C2-C6 end of the triangle. The CO2 reacts with the oil which results in a decrease in the interfacial tension. The decrease in interfacial tension would cause an increase in capillary number, which would cause an increase in residual oil saturation leading to additional oil recovery.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The model originally had 9 producers until the start of injection where 4 wells were converted to injectors. After the reservoir was modeled, different scenarios were simulated for the following 20 years. The variation of simulations included various injection patterns and different injection rates but no changes to the reservoir. Figures 5 shows the changes of oil saturation one year before, one year after and at the end of the injection period, respectively, with a 5 spot injection pattern. After injection was started the oil saturation drastically decreased with showed that there was additional production.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">It was found that the five spot pattern showed the most incremental recovery, possibly due to the gas drive pushing the oil towards to producing well in the middle. When the injection rate was increased in the simulations, it was found that the recovery increased regardless of injection pattern used. Figure 6 shows the result graph obtained from varying the injection rates of CO2 on five spot pattern. A summary table of all the results obtained from the simulation is seen in figure 1.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Due to the relatively low pressures within these reservoirs where immiscible CO2 EOR would occur, the compressor would not be required to pressurise the recycled CO2 at very high pressures. To achieve this, a series of three compressors would be used. Figure 7 shows a flow diagram of the produced CO2 gas until it is re-pressurised for re-injection.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">Results showed that the payback at $50/bbl was approximately 5.5 yrs with an IRR of only 13%. Further analysis with respect to the IRR revealed that IRR decreased at higher values of oil price. This was attributed to the introduction of the SPT when the price of oil exceeds $50/bbl. This had a negative impact on project economics as shown in Figure 9.</p><div id="link-9">
