<p id="Ancr8">A yard test to determine an optimum mill design was conducted. A conventional step mill with pads from tungsten-carbide composite material milled the shoulder of the XN-nipple in approximately 20 minutes; however, due to the rough surface, the Incoloy 925 test specimen could not be drifted to the required drift. A modified junk mill with a crushed carbide crown made slower progress, but created a smooth surface and thus achieved the required drift. For the actual job on Sh Z1a, a combined mill was manufactured; the mill is a step mill with tungsten-carbide pads followed by a crushed carbide crown. A picture of the yard test rig up is shown in Fig. 6, and the combined mill is shown in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">The reasons for selecting the 2.125-in. [54.0-mm] turbodrill drive plus impregnated bit have been described above. This turbodrill was designed as a short one-piece construction for use on CT with all-metallic construction for use in high temperatures. Although it had had some previous, limited commercial use, it had not drilled any formation. A comparison of the 2.125-in. [54-mm] PDM and the 2.125-in. turbodrill specifications are shown in Table 2, and the basics of the turbodrill assembly can be seen in Fig. 8.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">Liquid is stored into two 252 bbl [40 m3] storage tanks, and gas is flared via the stationary and permanent 16-in. flare of the production system. Solution gas from the liquid is flared with a separate 10-in. flare. To ensure a safe operation, an internal HAZID study, for the hookup of the test spread to the production flare, was conducted. A Wintershall-owned test spread and testing personnel were chosen for the operation. The P&amp;ID drawing of the test spread is shown in Fig. 9.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr14">A comparison of the ROP for both BHAs is shown in Fig. 12. The ROP while drilling the conventional sidetrack Sh Z1a is also shown as a reference. It can be seen that the combination of the impregnated bit with three PDC cutters, the turbodrill, and the optimization enabled from the real-time logging tools achieved the highest ROP. A decrease in average surface weight while drilling with the turbodrill indicates lower compression forces are required by the turbodrill. It can also be seen that ROP achieved by CT drilling (both PDM and turbodrill) was higher than the reference ROP achieved by conventional rotary drilling.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr15">Using the real-time logging tools and with the stable water pump rate, the influence of WOB can be analyzed. As shown in Fig. 13, ROP is improved due to higher weight on bit. The real-time downhole logging tools allowed the CT operator to control the WOB and thus increase the ROP. Slacking-off 200 lbf [91 kgf] has almost doubled the ROP from 23 ft/hr [~7 m/hr] to 43 ft/hr [13 m/hr]. The WOB was not increased further as the risk could not be justified while drilling close to reaching TD.</p><div id="link-13">
