<p id="Ancr6">The first step in evaluating the infill drilling opportunities was to history match the most-likely (or base case) simulation model using production, injection, pressure and soft (4D seismic) data. This deterministic model was run to end of lease life with wells in the approved field development plan to identify areas with significant by-passed/un-swept oil. The proposed infill wells were then tested individually to target the by-passed oil (See Figure 6). An optimum development scenario was run to test all proposed subsurface infill locations combining both injectors and producers with the wells ranked on the basis of incremental recovery.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">Manifolds with excess capacity were preferred for targets that could be reached from more than one manifold (See Figure 7). An important lesson that was learned at this stage and carried forward was to ensure that all facility, drilling and completions constraints are built into the forecast workflow early in the life of the project to minimize surprises down the line. This helped the project team quickly assess the potential infill targets to know which opportunities were immediately executable using the existing subsea infrastructure and which opportunities would require new subsea infrastructure.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The OVAAT approach was used to capture the impact of each uncertainty on the objective function. The objective function was defined as EUR at Lease life. The Initial production (IP) rates for the three Agbami Phase 3 producers not yet online were determined using well performance (IPR + VLP) modelling coupled to a production network model and benchmarked with the performance of existing offset wells. The OVAAT showed that the big-hitter uncertainties were the subsurface model, the Initial Production rates for the Agbami Phase 3 Producers not yet online, the Productivity Index (PI) of Agbami Phase 3 Wells and Water Injection Efficiency (See Figure 9).</p><div id="link-9">
