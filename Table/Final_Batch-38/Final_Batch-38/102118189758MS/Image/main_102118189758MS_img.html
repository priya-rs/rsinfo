<p id="Ancr6">Drilling started in 1947 with 214 ac/well (1,000 m spacing) using 7-spot hexagonal patterns. In 1956, an infill drilling program was implemented with 71 ac/well (577 m spacing). Although, government regulation required a minimum 600 m spacing for Eocene reservoirs, 577 m was accepted as it was close to the regulation while achieving equidistance between adjacent wells inside the original 1,000 m well spacing (Figure 5a). After 1996, the reservoir was developed only at 577 m spacing with some exceptions due to surface limitations, multi-pad drilling, and deviated wells.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Water injection in the Boscan field was initiated between 1957 and 1963 as water disposal with no fixed configuration (Mendez, et al., 2014). In 1997, four inverted 7-spot patterns were developed as a Water Injection and Pressure Maintenance (WIPM) pilot in the central portion of the field, named Area A (Figure 6). Based on the data analysis of water disposal area, Area A performance and reservoir modeling, the WIPM projects were expanded into Area B (8 patterns in 2004) and Phase 1 (8 patterns in 2007 &amp; 2011). The expansion projects used vertical wells in a pseudo 1-3-1 inverted 7-spot pattern configuration as shown in Figure 5b.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">The primary production data analysis quantified the impact of the reservoir depth (oil viscosity and pressure) on initial production (IP) rate, a key well performance indicator. Only early wells, those drilled before the start of infill drilling or waterflooding, were considered for this analysis. The mid-perforation depth of each well was considered its target reservoir depth. Figure 7 displays well IP vs depth, showing a clear trend with higher IPs in deeper reservoirs.

After 25+ years of water injection in Area A and 10 years in Phase 1, cumulative water injection is still less than 10% of the hydrocarbon pore volume.

<p id="Ancr16">The calculation using the representative dynamic model shows that the novel configuration can achieve similar recoveries as the conventional smaller spacing alternatives, but with fewer number of wells and smaller amount of water injected into the reservoir (Figure 15a and Figure 15b). Water cut of the infill producers (between first and second row producers) are smaller than the first-row producers, and therefore pattern level water cut is reduced. Conversely, the poor displacement and sweep efficiencies results into a long tail of production at high water cut (Figure 15c) for conventional infill configuration.</p><div id="link-15">

The final incremental recovery obtained in the full-field model is similar to that achieved using the representative symmetry element model used for selecting the infill configuration. The main difference in results comes in the rate production profile, as the full-field model incorporated more detailed study (drilling schedule, interference with existing wells, regional geologic characteristics, etc.).</p><div id="link-18">
