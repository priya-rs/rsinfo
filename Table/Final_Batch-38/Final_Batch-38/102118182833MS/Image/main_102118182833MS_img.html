<p id="Ancr8">The offshore Manifa oil field was discovered in 1957. It is located in the Arabian Gulf (Figure 1) approximately 200 km northwest of Dhahran. The entire field measures approximately 45 km in length and 18 km in width, encompassing both onshore and offshore areas with water depths between 4 and 6 m (Carpenter, 2014). Production began in 1964, but due to low crude oil demand, production was stopped in 1984, and the facilities were mothballed in 1985.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">New technologies were pivotal and central to the Manifa field development; fit-for-purpose technologies were successfully implemented to overcome numerous challenges in a cost effective and environmentally friendly manner (Xia et al., 2014). The Manifa reservoir has five main layers, but only two of them are considered as reservoirs targeted for development. The two intervals contain both heavy oil and relatively lighter crude (Carpenter, 2014). A typical stratigraphy column (Pollastro et al., 2003) of the Arabian Gulf is shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr11">A general schematic workflow implemented in the current study to conduct the geomechanical analysis is shown in Figure 4. The fundamental approach for any geomechanical analysis is to integrate all available data or indications of rock strength, deformability, in-situ stress, pore pressure, etc., into a 1D-MEM, then to calibrate it as rigorously as possible using available measurements and observations to arrive at an internally consistent representation of the key geomechanical properties and parameters needed for subsequent analyses and engineering designs (Plumb et al., 2000).</p><div id="link-4">
