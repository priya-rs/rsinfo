<p id="Ancr1">Production started from the field in 1965 (figure 1) and reached a maximum rate of 36,000bopd in 1973. The total production from the field was 33,439bopd gross with 38% BSW and 9.6MMscf/d gas production, which is processed and sold to the domestic market. There is 90Mbopd ullage in the field’s two flow stations and 54MMscf/d ullage in the gas handling facilities.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The total gap volumes in field A was130.8MMstb pre-TLVCR. After the review, this was reduced. The total oil volumes identified during the TLVCR was 107MMstb(unrisked) and 70 MMstb(risked). There was a substantial coverage of the gap volumes in most reservoirs. This could be seen in the in figure 3 below.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Recovery trend for each reservoir was done to see the influence of fluid properties on the recovery. This was done using the bubble plots. General observation was that better recovery was achieved with reservoirs that have lighter fluid properties (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The plot above clearly shows D2X reservoir to have low recovery even after the review. Although some of the gap volumes were closed with reference to Annual Revue of Petroleum Resources ultimate recovery, the Technical Limit recovery factor seems too high and unattainable. This is because the crude is very viscous. It has a thin oil column underlain by water (figure 5). Fine sand production is also a major set back to the maximization of recovery from this reservoir. This low recovery is also the case with reservoirs characterised by viscous crude, example the D3X reservoir.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Opportunities identified were later ranked using the Boston matrix (figure 6). The boston matrix weighs Scope For Recovery (SFR) volumes identified against their probability of maturation. Most projects identified in A field had medium to high probability of maturation. The gas projects identified have high probability of maturation. The commercial and political sides of the project identified evaluate the likelihood for execution to be approximately above 50%. This was an indicator that most opportunities identified are very feasible.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Based on the above activity plan, a road map (figure 8) was made to harness the gains of the studies inorder to increase oil production from the field. Drilling assumed 4 wells per year in order to maintain a manageable rig activity level. The optimal activity plan was to carry out the studies in phases. This was to enable early reserves bookings and drilling activities. This was also done to enable results from early wells to be fed back into plan. The opportunity framing with the studies team was scheduled for same year after which the studies was expected to kick off.</p><div id="link-8">
