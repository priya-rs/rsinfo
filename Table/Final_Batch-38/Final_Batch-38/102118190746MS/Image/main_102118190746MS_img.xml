<anchoringText id="Ancr4">The drilling mud filtrate and tracer composition was monitored throughout drilling up to the time of formation testing. Figure 2 shows the variation of the SCN tracer with depth in the well (SCN was measured by spectrophotometry after complexing with ferric ions). SCN varies after the sampled zone had been drilled and before the water samples were collected but the variation was small (&#x003C;5.2% relative standard deviation, RSD). Mud filtrate K and Cl were measured by colorimetry and titration respectively and their variation over the same interval was &#x003C;1.5% RSD.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">Figure 5 shows results from 1-D reactive transport Models 1 and 2. Model 1 (black line) shows the Sr and SCN compositions of water produced from the well during sampling when no reactions occur. The compositions lie on a linear trend between mud filtrate and the formation water. Model 2 (red line) shows the Sr and SCN compositions of water produced from the well during sampling when ion exchange reactions occur. At higher mud filtrate fractions the produced water is enriched in Sr relative to Model 1 due to Sr release from ion exchange sites.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">As these were 1-D simulations, they were not meant to predict the actual produced water composition over time which will, in part, be dependent on the mixing of different waters with varying mud filtrate content as they flow to the well. Although the 1-D models do not simulate these mixing processes, they can be used to constrain the composition of the mixed waters. For example, the shaded area in Figure 6 identifies the range of Sr and SCN concentrations such waters could have; this area is bounded by Model 2 equilibrium compositions (solid blue line) and associated tangent compositions (blue dashed lines).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">This concept was used to estimate the formation water concentration of those ions affected by reactions during mud invasion. Model 2 was run several times whilst varying the formation water concentrations of these ions. For example, the highest possible formation water concentration for an ion was identified where the water sample composition (i.e. the average of the water samples+1 sigma standard deviation) lies below and outside the shaded area (Figure 7).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr10">Similarly, the lowest possible formation water concentration for an ion was identified where the water sample composition (i.e. the average of the water samples-1 sigma standard deviation) lies above and outside the shaded area (Figure 8). The results of these calculations for Na, Ca, Mg and Sr are given in Table 2. The estimated concentration is the mid-point between the lower and higher values noted above and the uncertainty is the high value minus the mid-point value. The method was also used to obtain estimates of K and Ba in the formation water. For K, the uncertainties on the formation water concentration were too high and so an alternative method was used to estimate the concentration.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">During mud filtrate invasion in 1-D reactive transport Model 2, significant amounts of Ba are displaced from the ion exchange surfaces by K. Ba from this source, and Ba in the formation water, both react with SO4 in the mud filtrate to precipitate BaSO4 in the formation, initially close to the well and subsequently further from the well as invasion continues (see Figure 9). Due to dispersion, BaSO4 precipitation continues deeper in the formation during extraction but ceases as the fraction of formation water increases nearer the well. In Model 2, the excess Ba released from the ion exchange sites results in 3.1 times more barite precipitation in the formation than the equivalent case where no ion exchange occurs (Model 3).</anchoringText>
