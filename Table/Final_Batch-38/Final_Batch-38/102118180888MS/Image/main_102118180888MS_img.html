<p id="Ancr3">The effect of the aquifer volumes and connectivity can be divided into three broad categories [2]. This is demonstrated on the classical P/z plot below in Figure 3. The P/z plot is based on the material balance equation for gas reservoirs and assumes all examples have the same static gas in place. The pink line and point on the plot shows a case of pure volumetric depletion where the connected gas in place calculated, agrees with the x-axis extrapolation. The abandonment pressure and cessation of production is largely due to the platform back pressure. Low pressure access, such as compression in offshore facilities, can increase the recovery factor.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Sub-faulting to these regional faults locally influence structures and creates the traps for many reservoirs. These faults also add complexity to the reservoir by causing baffles or barriers to fluid flow which has short and long term effects on production. Where faults formed part of the trapping mechanism and/or were part of the sub-regional extent of the reservoir, the reservoir was designated to have some structural limit to the aquifer. The degree of aquifer limits varies by the number and geometry of faults that create the trap. Five classes of structural limits to the aquifer were defined (See figure 4). This in addition to structural dip of reservoir was catalogued for each reservoir.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">In some areas there are additional depositional elements such as slumping, canyon and channel development, and soft sediment deformation, see Fig. 5b. In depositional settings these features can create stratigraphic edges to reservoirs and help define the reservoir trap. Within the reservoir, the scale of these elements in combination with varying degrees of connectivity between sand bodies creates vertical and horizontal barriers and baffles. This adds complexity to fluid flow and can affect production rate and recovery. In these instances the reservoir is designated to have stratigraphic limits to the aquifer.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">The first focus area was a quick look into the relationship between sediment age and pool size. In Figure 8 below, Pleistocene rocks (TQ) appear to have higher incidences of pressure support from the aquifer when compared to the older Pliocene (TP) rocks. This is likely due to the fact that most of the TQ reservoirs have higher porosity and permeability and as a result higher aquifer connectivity. Most are also shallower reservoirs where the faulting may typically be like Figure 4b and so the reservoir is connected to a large aquifer volume and as a result leads to a good combination of higher aquifer connectivity and volume.</p><div id="link-10">
