<p id="Ancr10">How the east coast demand is to be met is a challenge for the future. Figure 1 shows that the Australian population is expected to grow reasonably linearly from the current (2018) estimate of 25 million people to a population of 42 million by 2050 and 70 million by the turn of the century (2100). This growth in population is expected to increase the demand for domestic gas but whether this turns into a linear increase in demand depends on the future energy mix, which may be affected by future government policy. Australia is also well placed to serve the large population centres of Asia, and, consequently, the demand for LNG from Asia is expected to feed a robust export market for Australian LNG.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr11">Domestically Australia sources most of its energy from oil, natural gas and coal, as shown in Figure 2. Wind and solar power collectively have moved ahead of hydroelectric power in recent years, but all three are still relatively small players in the nation's energy supply.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr12">The history of natural gas production in Australia is shown in Figure 3. Until 1989, all of the gas production was used domestically [See Figure 3]. However, in 1989 exports of LNG commenced from the North Rankin reservoir in Western Australia's Carnarvon Basin. Figure 3 also shows that the reserve life of Australia's natural gas resources has been as high as 83 years (in 1980). However, with the development of new LNG facilities, the reserve life has been falling rapidly and as of 2017, it stood at 38 years. New gas reserves are not being added rapidly enough and these are urgently needed to serve the east coast market and to feed the robust LNG export market that has been won at considerable capital cost.</p><div id="link-3">

The coals are extensive and ubiquitous throughout the basins but the developments target the sweet spots where CSG production can be optimized and maximized.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr14">Commercial CSG production began in the Bowen Basin in 1997 and in the Surat Basin in 2004 (see Figure 5). As of 2018, 98% of the natural gas being produced in Queensland is coal seam gas. 80% of the gas being produced in Queensland is being exported as LNG. The CSG production and LNG export is expected to reach its peak and plateau in 2020.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr15">Underschultz, Vink [3] have reviewed the water production from coal seam gas in Queensland and concluded that the water production is expected to peak at about 70-80 GL/y, which is only 25% of the original forecasts from independent authorities and 70% of estimates forecast by industry (see Figure 8). Figure 6 shows that the produced volumes of water from CSG wells is closely related to the number of wells put into production. Figure 7 shows the historical and projected future water production from CSG wells. This contrasts with what was projected to be produced from CSG wells when the developments were first proposed, as shown in Figure 8. This is discussed by Towler, Firouzi [2] and Underschultz, Vink [3].</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr21">Inpex is leading the development of the Ichthys field in the Browse Basin, offshore from the northern part of the Western Australia (see Figure 12). Because it is closer to Darwin, the LNG plant has been located at Bladin Point, which is quite near Conoco's LNG plant at Wickham Point near the city of Darwin in the Northern Territory. The Bladin Point plant is connected via pipeline from the Ichthys field. Inpex has announced that Ichthys contains reserves of 12.8 TCF (3.7×1011 m3) of gas and 500 MM-barrels of condensate. The pipeline has been built to the processing facilities at Bladin Point is 890 km long.</p><div id="link-12">
