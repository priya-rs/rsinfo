<p id="Ancr2">Primary production and secondary recovery operations improve only one-third to one-half of the original oil in place in reservoirs (Hall et al., 2003; Youssef et al., 2007; Gudina et al., 2012); therefore, attentions are focused on the enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques to recover more hydrocarbon from the existing and abandoned oilfields. Figure 1 shows the different EOR techniques applicable to a hydrocarbon reservoir (Sen, 2008; Hosseininoosheri, 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The dissolution of CO2 in brine decreases the pH of the brine, which leads to a solubility increase of many minerals present in the formation rock. Therefore, CO2 reacts directly and indirectly with minerals of the formation rock, leading to the precipitation of secondary carbonate minerals (Hosseini et al., 2018; Ampomah et al., 2016; Han, 2008; Xu et al., 2004). Figure 2 shows the four main trapping mechanisms that lead to CO2 storage in a CO2-EOR process.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">To investigate the impact of different CO2 injection scenarios (i.e. CGI and WAG) on the CO2 utilization ratios, we integrated three main elements of field assessment: field characterization based on measured data (geocellular model), field production-pressure history performance, and reservoir simulation (CMG-GEM). The integration of these three elements enables us to build a simulation model that gives us the most reliable results (Hosseininoosheri et al., 2016; Khan et al., 2017). Figure 3 shows the summary of our approach in modeling the SACROC performance.</p><div id="link-3">

The original model was constructed to mimic the heterogeneity and structure of Northern Platform of the SACROC unit.

<p id="Ancr7">Further, the relative permeability, which has a significant impact on CO2-oil-brine dynamics in the reservoir (Delshad et al., 2013), is chosen from the data of two wells in the study area (Schepers et al., 2007). However, because of the high heterogeneity of the reservoir, the data were sparse for different core samples; therefore, Corey’s functions were used for relative permeability curves. Figure 6 shows the relative permeability curves matched with core data.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Although it is important to have reliable values for gas relative permeability (Salahshoor and Fahes, 2017), to the knowledge of the authors, there were no available data for liquid-gas relative permeabilities for the SACROC unit. Thus, Corey’s function was used and end points were set during the history matching. Figure 7 shows the liquid-gas relative permeability curves used in this study.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">We used the average pressure of the study area calculated in the report prepared for the U.S. Department of Energy by Schepers et al. (2007). Using this pressure data, we adjusted the production and injection data for the missing period (1948–1978). Figure 8 shows the average reservoir pressure during the simulation compared to the field data. Although history matching can always be improved, the achieved match is satisfactory for the objectives of this project. In this study, history matching is necessary to assure that the initial point of different CO2–EOR scenarios (e.g., WAG and CGI) is based on the field behavior.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">In addition, the entire historical production and injection data (1949–2016) were not available for the study area, but we could access the data for the period from 1978 to 2010. In order to obtain the history match, different parameters (e.g., permeability, relative permeabilities, porosity) were modified and, more important, 12 pseudo-wells were introduced to mimic the boundary condition of the study area. Schepers et al. (2007) calculated a material balance on the edge of the study area and reported the influx of water. However, they assumed that there is only water influx on the edges of the reservoir and they ignored oil and gas influx on the boundary. Figure 9 shows the history matched oil, water, and gas production data.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Two field development strategies are investigated in the present study: 1) a water-alternating-gas (WAG), where we assumed that the operator would have done WAG injection with the WAG ratio of 1 (six months of CO2 injection followed by six months of water injection shown in Figure 10); and 2) a continuous gas injection (CGI), where we assumed that the operator would have done continuous gas injection from the beginning of CO2 injection (01/01/1983 in the study area). In CGI, the water injection rate is zero and the CO2 injection rate is the same as the CO2 injection rate in the WAG scenario.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">In both injection scenarios, we keep the reservoir average pressure the same as the history matched average reservoir pressure. Therefore, the average reservoir pressure is the restriction in this study, because if we did not have pressure restriction, then the oil production would be much higher due to the continuous tertiary EOR technique that we are applying to the field. The CO2 injection rate is calculated based on the average reservoir pressure. Figure 11 shows the CO2 injection patterns of the two scenarios (CGI and WAG) and the historical CO2 injection of the field.</p><div id="link-11">

Therefore, we plotted the amount of produced oil for the assumed field development strategies and compared it with the produced oil from the history of the field which was undergone a short period of CO2 injection and waterflood for the rest. Figure 12 shows the cumulative oil production for WAG, CGI, and history.</p><div id="link-12">
