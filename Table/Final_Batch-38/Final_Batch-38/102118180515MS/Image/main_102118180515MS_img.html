<p id="Ancr3">To ensure robustness of the CDE, significant research and development were invested to refine the design and manufacturing processes to optimize the element’s material properties. Although the CDEs are made of polycrystalline diamond similar to conventional PDC cutters, they are manufactured using proprietary equipment to achieve the necessary pressures to produce their significant impact strength and wear resistance. Compared with a conventional PDC cutter, a CDE is approximately twice as thick at the conical tip (Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">To quantitatively measure the CDE’s impact strength compared with a conventional PDC cutter, a series of laboratory tests were conducted using a single-cutter device. Both elements were dropped onto a hardened steel block with an impact force of 18,000 lbf [80,000 N]. The experiment would simulate transitional drilling of a PDC bit exiting soft shale then encountering hard limestone at an ROP of 60 ft/hr. The conventional PDC cutter suffered catastrophic failure on first impact which completely destroyed the cutter’s sharp edge (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

The undesirable drillstring harmonics require more mechanical specific energy input to the system, which can lower ROP and reduce run lengths.

Results showed that the CDE has a more balanced force profile when both are placed across the bit face (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

Therefore, the best strategy for optimizing performance and minimizing drilling risk involves drilling the interval with minimum steering requirements and moving all directional requirements to a deeper interval. However the subject section comprised hard, dense, and abrasive sandstone, which posed steering difficulties, shock and vibration, and damage to the bit and BHA. With this strategy, the main challenge now is to achieve directional requirement (Figure 13), steering the well through hard, dense, and abrasive sandstones.</p><div id="link-13">
