<p id="Ancr3">The Greater Burgan field (Fig. 1), discovered in 1938, is located in southeast Kuwait and comprises the Magwa, Ahmadi, and Burgan fields, constituting the largest known siliciclastic oil reservoir on Earth. The size of the field, 20-km wide and 37.5-km length, provides an estimate of its large extension. The three main formations of Wara, Burgan, and Mauddud have a global total thickness of 1,500 ft with complex behaviors resulting from fluvial/tidal depositional settings.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Formation-tester measurements were used to estimate relative permeability based on the workflow depicted in Fig. 2. The inputs of this workflow were pressure transient measurements from miniDSTs in oil, water, transition zones, and water saturation logs. The followings steps are described in Fig. 2:</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">To determine the curvature of relative permeability, the effective permeabilities of oil and water multiplied by pay zone thickness are measured in the transition zone. Fig. 4 shows how to obtain relative permeability of oil and water in the transition zone. Increasing the number of miniDSTs in the transition zone adds confidence to the estimated curvature.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">A formation tester with a simple circular probe was used to perform the miniDST because of the large mobility expected in the reservoir. Based on the logs, four points were selected for fluid pumpout; from top, the first point was at irreducible water saturation; second and third points were in the transition zone; and the last point was in the free water zone. Table 1 summarizes the wireline-conveyed formation tester pumpout points along with their purpose and associated water saturation. Fig. 5 shows the pumpout points along with formation evaluation log data and interpretation.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">The downhole effective permeability estimation was described in detail. After following the workflow, the effective permeability data obtained from the miniDST analyses was divided by the absolute permeability to yield the relative permeability curves (Fig. 10). The curve connecting the points is a best-fit curve obtained by minimizing the fit error. The relative permeability of Fig. 10 shows a mixed to water-wet reservoir rock for the Burgan middle sand.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr15">To overcome the uncertainty in saturation of each tested depth, resistivity, dielectric, and NMR logs were run to estimate fluid saturation separately. Table 2 shows the minimum and maximum saturation values chosen based on these measurements, and Fig. 13 shows the uncertainty envelope generated for the relative permeability curves. The results were in line with pulsed neutron capture (PNC) saturation logs over the years.</p><div id="link-13">
