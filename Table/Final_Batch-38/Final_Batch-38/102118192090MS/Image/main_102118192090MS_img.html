<p id="Ancr6">In November 2014, an appraisal well, B-2 was drilled on the opposite side of the fault line, NW of B-1 as shown in Fig. 1-2. This well encountered an 81.8 ft stacked hydrocarbon bearing Cycle II M30 Group with average net-to-gross (NTG) of 0.45. The thickest sand package encountered in B-2 well is M34, and is part of the M30 group of sand package (M30, M34, M36, M40, and M44). Most of these sand units are clean blocky channel-distributary mouth-bar and crevasse splay deposits. The depositional facies in the Cycle-II are interpreted as being a mix of distributary channels, inter-distributary channels and channel/bar composite units, encompassed within levee/crevasse splay and other flood plain deposits and coals from marshes and swamps.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">Based on Fig. 22, Field B UCS were correlated to be 1810.7 psi and 1932.3 psi. The values were within the range of UCS discussed in the result of IUCS test of Field B Rock Mechanic study. This showed that despite the core length were shorter than required, the results of the Field B sidewall cores IUCS (Refer to Table 2-4) matched the rock strength correlation of nearby Field A and were not overestimated. Fig. 2-3 plotted the result of the 1D Geomechanical model of Field B; the UCS, Internal Friction Coefficient, Poisson Ratio and Young's Modulus. Thus, the Rock Mechanic properties derived from IUCS and MST result of Field B sidewall cores were utilized to calibrate the Mechanical Earth Model and the Sand Onset Study.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">In any event where the rock mechanics test on cores were absent, UCS may also be estimated based on geological logging data (porosity, elastic moduli or porosity) using empirical relationships. For example, Chang et al. (2006) listed multiple empirical relationships derived from case studies in different geological setting. For Field B analysis, empirical analysis was included as the third method in determining the UCS and the equations used are listed in Appendix B. In addition to the UCS calculation, other log derived parameters were evaluated to generate the MEM. These log derived dynamic values were then calibrated with actual lab generated static values and the calibration results as shown in Fig. 2-4.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr11">The k &amp; c in Eq. [3] and [4] are calibration constants. It is to be noted here that the method of transformation of stresses from field level to well level was conducted during the calculations. This also includes the deviation with respect to horizontal stresses which were included in the simulator to generate CDP plots in Fig. 2-5. The calibrated MEM were employed for the Sand Onset Prediction study done using in-house Sand Prediction simulator.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr12">For the first concern, nodal analysis was performed with sensitivity over various gun types with different Gun Phasing (60°, 180° and 0°) and Perforation Efficiency (90, 70 and 50%). The variation in Gun Phasing represented the difference between Oriented Perforation and Full Perforation, while Perforation Efficiency variation demonstrating the case of Selective Perforation. The initial reservoir pressure is 1400 psi and target production rate is 2500 bbl. Fig. 2-6 shows the result of the sensitivity analysis. At different perforation efficiencies, the calculated liquid rates ranges from 3080 bbl to 3490 bbl, which are higher than the targeted 2500 bbl.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr13">As the reservoir pressure depleted 18% down to 1150 psi (expected in year 2 of field life), the overall flow rate is still above 2500 bbl as shown in Fig. 2-7. At this point, the field is anticipated to start the water injection for pressure support, which is planned in Phase 2 development. The pressure is expected to maintain around this value until the end of field life.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr15">Result on the impact of reduction of UCS &amp; Pore Pressure for Oriented Perforation can be seen in Fig. 2-9. It shows an average CDP value of 150 psi was obtained for more than 95% of the producing interval, which is close to the actual drawdown at which the well was planned to be produced. The mitigation planned was to avoid perforating the 5% length of weak spots. This 5% reduction of perforation interval (Selective Perforation) was already taken into account during analysis of Perforation Efficiency impact. Therefore, the concern of uncentainty in UCS was taken into account in the worst case scenario runs and Oriented Perforation may delay the sand onset in this case.</p><div id="link-11">
