<anchoringText id="Ancr2">Several reservoir treatment technologies have been proposed for improving CO2 flood performance. Technologies such as polymer gel treatments and cementing can be effective in the near well-bore region (Sydansk, 1998), but their applicability in far field conformance control is limited (Seright R. Z., 2007)(Wang et al. 2003). Moreover, such techniques are typically irreversible and caution needs to be exercised while designing the treatments (Seright R., 1988). In comparison CO2-foam EOR technology (Heller, 1994) offers a robust method for CO2 mobility control, especially in zones quite far from the injector well. Thus CO2-foam EOR, has been proposed as an effective technology for correcting sweep inefficiencies due to gravity segregation and reservoir heterogeneity. The concepts are illustrated in Figure 1.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr3">A careful examination of historical production and injection data was performed for various patterns showing indications of poor gas utilization. An inverted 5-spot pattern in the Phase V area of Salt Creek field, with 22SE30 as the pilot injector and wells: 15SE30, 14SE30, 26SE30 and 28SE30; as the four production wells to be monitored, was screened as the best candidate for the CO2 foam EOR pilot (Figure 2).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr13">To do so, we extended the trend curves on oil production rates from the 4 pilot wells, established over one year of baseline data collected from the wells. Integrating the extended trend curves for all the 4 production wells over time then provides a projection of the baseline WAG performance had there been no foam implemented in the field. The actual data on oil production from all the 4 producers in the field is then integrated with respect to time and summed up to get the response realized due to foam implementation in the pilot pattern. In this analysis we chose the one year period prior to the start of foam pilot to establish the baseline performance since there were minimal perturbations to the pilot area as a result of field projection during this time window. Our analysis is summarized in Figure 12.</anchoringText>
