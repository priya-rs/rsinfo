<p id="Ancr3">This is the data source used. However, the Vaca Muerta formation produces hydrocarbons ranging from black oil to dry gas. A fluid distribution map of Vaca Muerta (Dirección General de Estudios 2017; Gutiérrez Schmidt et al. 2014), with class boundaries defined by initial dissolved gas-oil ratios of 20,000, 2,500, 750 and 250 scf/bbl, has been used as a base to classify wells by produced fluid. According to the location of the wells relative to the fluid zones in the map, the wells were classified as black-oil, volatile-oil, gas-condensate, wet-gas, and dry-gas (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Detailed sequential seismostratigraphic interpretation is considered key in framing the characterization of the Vaca Muerta formation and revealing its systematic lateral and vertical changes. This helped materialize the "Transecta regional Vaca Muerta" project (González et al. 2016), which defined a consented and simple stratigraphic scheme of regional reach (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

In cases in which the power law exponent is greater than 1, it is replaced by a linear trendform. The modeled cumulative production is calculated, and from it, an average daily production rate is derived. We introduce an arbitrary decline factor that nullifies this rate in 20 years (7,200 effective days) using the cumulative production curve equation (Fig. 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr25">After modeling the type curves for black-oil-producing wells in zones 2a and 2b, both could be compared to their cumulative and derived rates (Fig. 24). Wells located in 2b were shown to be approximately 30% more productive than the wells located in 2a. This is merely a quantitative conclusion that is derived by applying the methodology to the data of interest. For a similar sample, an integrated study (Licitra et al. 2015) showed comparable behavior with respect to production.</p><div id="link-23">
