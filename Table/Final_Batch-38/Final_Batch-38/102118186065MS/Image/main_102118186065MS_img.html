<p id="Ancr4">Some thin shales were not accounted for in the static model. To approximate their effect on vertical flow it was assumed that there was a relationship between “shaliness”, as indicated by the interpreted clay volume, “Vclay” from logs, and vertical permeability. A heuristic functional relationship between “Vclay” and a vertical transmissibility multiplier was proposed (Figure 3). The functional form of this relationship was adjusted in the history match. The impact of thin shales on lateral fluid movement was not considered.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The initial aquifer model was guided by the material balance studies. Aquifer influx was modeled using twelve Carter-Tracy aquifers attached to the periphery of the model. These aquifers were divided into three vertically and connected to four quadrants (Figure 4). The vertical boundaries for the aquifers were set at the base of Mauddud and at an intermediate surface within the BGSL1 reservoir. Both boundaries were believed to correspond to extensive baffles to flow.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The simulator can run a large model in less time than typical conventional simulators and the gap tends to widen as the number of CPUs used increases (DeBaun et al, 2005; Fjerstad et al, 2005; Tleukhabyluly et al 2016). Figure 5 shows how the overall run time covering the 70-year simulation correlates to the number of CPUs used in this model. When the same model was tested with a conventional simulator, the run times were prohibitive. Additionally, the performance advantage made it possible to maintain higher resolution versions of the model. The vertical resolution is nearly double with 7.4 million active grid cells and doubling the resolutions in all three-grid directions resulted in a 28 million active grid cell model.</p><div id="link-5">

Figure 9 shows an example of such comparisons from eight wells and demonstrates the inefficiency of performing the assessment with a large data set. To streamline this task, a special workflow was designed and implemented to display the geographical distribution of the 561 matches in each reservoir regardless of when the individual measurements were acquired.

<p id="Ancr17">A review of the Field/Gathering Centre /Reservoir performance plots made it was clear that one of the major inconsistencies between the model results and the observations was in the early water production (prior to 1985), as illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 15. Adjusting parameters in the “Vclay” model for vertical permeability modification and the model for immobile heavy oil enabled some improvement in the match to be made. The level of flow between reservoirs, in particular between the BGSL2 and BGSM reservoirs also had a major impact on this.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr18">In some earlier modelling efforts (Ambastha et al 2006) such flow was made possible by incorporating non-neighbor connections. This was incorporated on an ad hoc basis rather than being base on any geological features. In the current model, grid cells with elevated vertical transmissibility values were introduced. This is in line with the approach described by Van Lingen et al (2001). The extent and location of each conductive fault (Figure 16) was a matter of match refinement that was guided by the location of fault traces, geochemical data and seismic “Ant-Tracks” that identified possible small displacement faults not included in the static model. Additional improvements in matching field history were achieved by regional calibrations.</p><div id="link-17">

Documented well crossflow data were reviewed and crossflow allowed where it was consistent with the observed pressure and/or water production. In addition to the increased permeability, an identified Wara channel fairway in the southern Burgan field was modified to improve the match in the crestal area of Burgan.

The tests include the ability of these models to capture different levels of heterogeneity and the subsurface flow characteristics. Figure 18 demonstrates how water saturation in these models compare to the interpreted PNC values at eight selected wells. The figure shows some observable advantages of the maximum resolution grid (28 million active grid cells) in replicating the fine-scale fluctuation of the PNC water saturation values. Nevertheless, the four million active cells model grid was selected for the efficient execution of the calibration effort with moderate vertical and lateral grid resolutions.</p><div id="link-19">

As the understanding of the flow matured so did the impact on model predictivity. Figure 21 shows the comparsion between two models based on different geological realizations.</p><div id="link-22">

Each of these figures consists of four graphs for the comparison of average datum corrected pressure (top left), oil production rate (bottom left), gas-oil ratio (top right), and watercut (bottom right). In these graphs, black markers represent the measured historical values whereas the solid lines show the simulated results. It should be noted that the observed pressures were quality checked and only the high confidence points were included for comparison. In addition, for individual reservoirs in the model, pressure points were filtered such that only those measurements that were contained to one reservoir were chosen.</p><div id="link-23">
