<p id="Ancr3">The Sigyn Field is comprised of two separate accumulations with different fluid contacts. Sigyn West is a gas condensate filled structure. Two horizontal production wells were drilled on Sigyn West in 2001 – 2002. Sigyn East, discovered in 1997, consists of a volatile oil. A vertical production well was drilled on Sigyn East in 2002. An illustration showing the layout of the Sigyn subsea facility can be seen in Fig 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">One proposed method involved running a hydrostatic-set packer on the upper completion. This would allow the tubing to be run in the wellbore and used to displace the upper production liner with nitrogen prior to setting the production packer. The well could then be “jump-started” by flowing back to Sleipner with the reduced hydrostatic column in the wellbore (Fig 3). Although two analog wells had been identified in the North Sea, still the A-04 presented the most challenging case due to the lower reservoir pressure (~114 bar) and the inability to flow to the rig.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The start-up process was initiated with nitrogen gas injection from the rig into the well annulus so brine inside the annulus was displaced through GLV into the production tubing. During displacement, the accumulated gas mass and annulus pressure were increasing (Point1, Fig 5). Around T=8h, all the brine in annulus was replaced by nitrogen as shown by the accumulated blue line liquid mass curve and injection pressure was kept constant until T=10h.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">While nitrogen gas was entering the tubing through GLV, initial slug flow was taking place with the expansion of high pressured gas bubbles. The upward migration of slugs and gas bubbles decreased the liquid density in the tubing, as shown in Fig 6. Once part of tubing above GLV was replaced by nitrogen, the pressure inside the tubing reduced to the point where reservoir pressure was high enough to push drilling mud inside the lower completion upwards and the well was able to flow by itself.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Flow conditions in the lower completion are shown on Fig 7. Point 4 was located inside the 4-1/2” blank tubing above SAS. It can be seen that when the brine above GLV was displaced by nitrogen, pressure in the lower completion was decreasing gradually and then dropped sharply when mud was unloaded. The drop in liquid density (Green line) indicated the rapid displacement of mud by reservoir oil during the start-up.</p><div id="link-7">

Volume fraction of liquid curve behavior indicates that at T=5h, the tubing was still occupied by brine in the upper part and mud in the lower part (~ 1200m from the bottom hole). Hydrostatic pressure inside the tubing was high (&gt;240 bara), while bottomhole hydrostatic pressure was minimal. By T=10h, the well was completely cleaned out, with only reservoir oil and gas inside the tubing as illustrated by water volume fraction curve on Fig 9.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">As shown in Fig 10, the flow field below the production pack was modeled with the 2D axisymmetric geometry. The near-wellbore reservoir, annulus, tubing, screen and perforated base pipe were all included to capture relevant flow features. The inflow of the reservoir oil was evenly distributed across all the screen joints. With the open annulus (not collapsed during the start-up), instead of all the flow entering the base pipe through perforations, the flow was split into two parts (inside and outside of base pipe) and balanced by the pressure drop caused by friction.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">During the real-time operation, it was discovered that the real reservoir GOR was less than half of the value used in modeling. Additional modeling with observed GOR was conducted as shown in Fig 12. As shown real field GOR predicted gas rate had resulted in much lower predicted gas rate in accordance with observation. The fluid density curve in Fig 12 was adopted to indicate the major event during the well start-up period.</p><div id="link-12">
