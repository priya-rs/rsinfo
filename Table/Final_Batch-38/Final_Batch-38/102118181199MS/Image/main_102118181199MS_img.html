<p id="Ancr5">The general procedure of this combination is to make the unit run with coiled tubing (CT) and BHA cleaning (Fig. 2) composed of: shoe mill, flapper valve, collecting chamber, filter, cyclone bailer and engine's high torque which allows rotation directly on the bottom of the tool, working with pumping parameters to an average of 1.5 bpm to overcome the obstruction, performing test each 10ft pull forward, noting increased pressure and not get further advancement is indicative that the collecting chamber has reached its maximum capacity, so that pumping is reduced and proceeds to pull pipe and BHA cleaning surface; repeating the process until reaching the target depth and recover fully plug comprised of residues compacted with heavy crude elastomer, and samples collected in the collecting chamber were mainly sand, with no evidence of elastomers, to then proceed with cleaning conventional jet and pumping nitrogen allowing CT, to counteract the loss circulation well and recover the total obstruction of faster and cost effective way, additionally to the application of this technology cost is reduced by cleaning and operating well intervention time compared to conventional rehabilitation options drill.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The Cyclone Bailer is a tool operated by flow used in cleaning operations where circulation is not possible and the efficient removal of debris is required, consists of a top sub, nozzle section, output channel and bottom sub where it connects extension background filter (Fig. 3) between the nozzle section and the outlet channel diameter reduction occurs when the fluid there through; because it is a smaller area, the flow velocity increases and the pressure decreases in the narrow part, generating a strong vacuum, known as venturi (Fig. 4) effect described by Tipler, P., Mosca, G. (Ed. 2005), dragging the fluid and debris from the well into a collecting chamber (Bailer) by the strong suction effect, while the filter high performance allows fluid to pass through the ring but traps, collects and stores any debris or waste within section between the flapper valve bailer bottom and filter in the top section of the chamber.</p><div id="link-3">
