<p id="Ancr3">These major and well-known different units, prevent the conventional analysis of Voidage Replacement Ratio (VRR) as other conventional reservoirs (Figure 1). The initial completion design did not address the injection profile control and the majority of water was going to the unit UB5. The objective of using WFR is to improve the vertical sweep efficency by enabling the operator to maintain higher injection rates into layers less affected by waterflood induced problems.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Meanwhile, with the demand of pressure support and increasing number of producers, a new project in Upper Burgan for Effluent Water System has been started in 2014. Currently the injectors meet allowable that was specified based on simulation modeling target for Upper Burgan and it is approximately 100MBWPD. The current injection profile &amp; liquid production trend in Upper Burgan are shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The basic principle of WFR is from old Watermann patent form the 50’s. One piston is moveable and the other one is fixed as shown in Figure 3 [RAJ11] with the size variable depending on the flow desired to be injected in that certain layer so the regulator is calibrated by predetermined flow rate.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr11">Step Rate Injectivity Test (SRIT) was done in two zones before installing the regulators. The aim of this test is to determine Formation Parting Pressure (FPP) so as to create fractures and channels prior to installing WFR valves. Figure 9 shows four plots, in the left side, the pressure and rate for the pump and in the right side the well-known SRIT plot for each layer.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">The first implementation of WFR in Kuwait has proved the concept of improving vertical injection profile by enabling higher injection rates into layers that never received water before and regulating the distribution into all layers. As most of the water injected into the well (more than 90%) was traversing through one zone only before the job, the vertical distribution of injected water due to WFR approach resulted in choking the flow through this layer to about 60% and improve the flow through the remaining uncontacted layers like summirized in Table 1 and Figure 10.</p><div id="link-10">

Some of the offset producers are likely to take more time for getting benefit due to WFR, as there was injector Shut down for RWO &amp; rigless operation for almost 2 months.</p><div id="link-11">
