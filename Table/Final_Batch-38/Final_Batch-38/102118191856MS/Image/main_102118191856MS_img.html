<p id="Ancr5">The hydraulic fractures are dominated by tensile failure mechanisms, which generally are slow and a-seismic processes (generally low amplitude, low frequency) [Taleghani et.al. 2011] and therefore, do not generate important acoustic energy. Often, these tensile failures are not detected during microseismic monitoring. Microseismic events of high amplitude are generally related to rapid events produced by induced shear failure mechanisms (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr25">The final conclusion is that a complete structural feature was illuminated with the microseismic monitoring, showing the faulting associated with a fold structure. Figure 25a shows that: on the concave zone of the fold (heel of the horizontal section), compression dominates, leading to bedding-plane thrusts; on the limb zone (middle of the horizontal section), relaxation shows low-density faulting; and finally, on the convex side of the fold (toe of the horizontal section), tension produces normal extensional faults. Figure 25b only considers the filtered events by magnitude and SNR, making the different zones associated with the fold structure clearer. A change of azimuth observed along the lateral was not related to the hydraulic fracture, but to the local fold structure and its pre-existing plane of weakness (faults and natural fractures).</p><div id="link-25">
