<p id="Ancr17">The Pembina Cardium field is located in central Alberta, Canada (Figure 1). It is one of the largest conventional oil pools in Western Canada, covering an area of over 1,000 square miles with more than 9.4 million barrels of oil in place (OOIP) (Ghaderi et al., 2011; NEB, 2011). This field is located in a stratigraphic trap without bottom water and gas cap zones (Purvis and Bober, 1979).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr18">The greatly heterogeneous Cardium formation consists of lower, middle and upper sandstone members with low to medium permeability. The sandstone members are occasionally capped by some highly permeable conglomerate layers that have varying thickness from a few inches to approximately 20 ft (Adegbesan et al., 1996; Lin et al., 2015; Wahl and Gregg, 1963), as illustrated in Figure 2. Reservoirs and pools have been found at depths ranging from 3, 937 ft to 8, 858 ft (Krause et al., 1994). As a result, variations in fluid properties can be expected across the field. Generally, the solution gas-oil ratio (GOR) increases with depth from the northeast to southwest of the field. Based on a total of 55 PVT analyses summarized by Wahl and Gregg (1963), the GOR ranges from 271 to 933 scf/stb; the formation volume factor ranges from 1.15 to 1.48 bbl/stb; and the saturation pressure ranges from 1,200 to 2,450 psi across the field.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr33">Figure 17 displays the comparison of the ultimate oil recovery factor between the homogeneous case and the heterogeneous case for the 10 years’ CO2 injection. It can be seen that permeability heterogeneity has a great impact on CO2-EOR performance. A recovery discrepancy of 5.6% is observed between these two cases. This is because preferential flow paths are dictated by reservoir heterogeneity. The highly mobile CO2 seeks out more permeable paths with least resistance instead of flowing uniformly. In this way, it travels the same paths for the entire process, leaving a large amount of oil untouched, thereby leading to extremely unfavorable sweep efficiency.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr34">The sandstone members of the Cardium formation are occasionally capped by some highly permeable conglomerate layers that have varying thickness from a few inches to approximately 20 ft. A conglomerate member can act as a “thief” zone for the injected CO2 agent as a result of its high permeability (Dashtgard et al., 2008). To investigate the effects of a highly permeable conglomerate member on CO2 injection, permeability and porosity of the top layer were modified in the base model. Their values are listed in Table 16. In addition, a new set of relative permeability curves were generated for the conglomerate member, as plotted in Figure 18.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr35">The comparison of the ultimate oil recovery factor for the two cases is illustrated in Figure 19.Ascan be observed from the plot, the presence of conglomerate has a pronounced effect on CO2-EOR perfor- mance. Although the initial production rate is much higher with the presence of conglomerate, it declines much more quickly and, finally, results in a much lower oil recovery factor compared to the case without conglomerate. The primary cause of the lowered recovery is that the presence of conglomerate on the top of the Cardium formation leads to upward moving of CO2.</p><div id="link-19">
