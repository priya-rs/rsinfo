<p id="Ancr4">Based on the parameters analysis above, numerical simulation is also conducted for predicting the production performance of the LD oilfield with CSS. Well A2 is taken as an example for simulation and the constructed model is shown in Fig.1. Simulations under conditions of natural energy development and the cycle steam stimulation are both carried out and comparison is made for illustrating the effectiveness and feasibility of the CSS in LD Oilfield.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The simulation results and comparison is shown in Fig.2. We can see from the Figure that for cold production, the oil rate is lately low. And when developed with CSS, the oil rate is about 2 times of the value for cold production. And the cumulative oil production amount for CSS is also about 2 times of the cold production, which implies that the CSS is an effective production method for improving the recovery rate and oil production rate of the LD Oilfield.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The involved components of the generator include central steam generating system, water treatment system, fuel injection system, and monitoring and controlling system (as shown in Fig.3). And the detailed parameters of the generator and its comparison with onshore generator are listed in Tab.2. We can see from the table that almost 58% of the weight and 68% of the space are saved, and make it suitable for its use on the platform.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">For high temperature well completion, the metal mesh cloth composite liner + gravel pack sand control method is proposed for horizontal well (as what is shown in Fig.4). A thermal packer at the top of sand control string is added to solve sand production problems caused by sand control packer invalidation. A heat stress compensator is also added to release the thermal stress between sieve tubes.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Till now, the cumulative thermal oil production with CSS is about 60 thousand m3. When compared with the clod production, the peak oil production rate is about 5.3 times and cycle oil productivity is about 2 times that of the cold production, the valid time for each cycle is about 280 days. The predicted and actual data of the thermal wells produced with CSS are shown in Table 3 and Figure 5~6.

<p id="Ancr10">The simulated results is shown in Fig.7 and Fig.8. We can see from the results that with the increase of the stimulation cycle, the thermal sweep radius of the heat increases, accordingly. But the increase trend slows down obviously after 7 stimulation cycles. So, for expanding the thermal sweep radius, enhancing the heat utilization and improving the steam stimulation performance for after several stimulation cycles, gas (N2, et al) or chemical agent (viscosity reducer, et al) are recommended to be added.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr13">With the continuing development process, formation pressure would be decreased gradually. The average pressure of near well bore region for Well A2 is simulated and shown in Fig.10. We can see from the result that the pressure decreased gradually and was less than half of the initial value after developed for about 2 cycles, which indicated that the formation energy is not sufficient. That might be the reason why the daily liquid production rate is not as high as what we predicted.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">For understanding the produced degree of the thermal well in our offshore LD Oilfield, the temperature and pressure testing for high temperature environment is conducted at the second stimulation cycle of Well A1. The measured temperature and pressure distribution along the horizontal section during the soak process is shown in Fig.11. We can see from the Figure that the measured temperature decreases gradually with the increase of the measured depth from 2050 to 2150m.</p><div id="link-11">
