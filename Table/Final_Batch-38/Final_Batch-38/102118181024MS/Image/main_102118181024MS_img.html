This exercise resulted in 395 oil fields and 905 gas fields, indicating that GoM is mainly a gas-prone basin. Figure 3 displays the classification of data present in GoM dataset (the definitions of acronyms are available in the nomenclature of this paper). Gas volumes (Mscf) is converted to barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) and is used in calculations. Data for deepwater oilfields (Sand type = “O”) is selected for this study.</p><div id="link-3">

Scaling of attributes and removal of outliers is an essential step for preparing data as an input to various data mining algorithms. In this step, data quality is checked by inspecting or removing impaction of dataset. For example, some redundant and unuseful or missing valves from the database was inspected or removed.</p><div id="link-4">

The scatter of data illustrates complexity of basin where various geological, reservoir, completions and operating constraints interacts resulting in definite behavior of fields in terms of production. This behavior is quantified by physical quantities like production rates of fluids and gases. Figure 5 shows wide variation for reported recovery factor for reservoirs having comparable porosity, permeability, sand thickness and fluid properties.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">PCA is run on original attributes as shown in Error! Reference source not found., the clusters were obtained using distance based K-means algorithm. However, PLS regression on these clusters is unable to predict recovery factor with accuracy as shown in Figure 7. In addition, first two principal component (PC1 &amp; PC2) are able to capture only 30% of variance in data. Therefore, reservoir models needs to be scaled before application of PLS algorithms, which is done for water drive reservoir in next section.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr12">The reason for this behavior is not completely known, but it can attributed to difference in petro-physical (heterogeneity) characteristics of reservoirs, which dimensionless groups does not capture. Figure 10 shows the statistical distribution of dimensionless numbers for different clusters. It is discovered that when a cluster is having higher ‘Npc’, its ‘Ng’ is also higher. Another way to visualize clustering is through biplots in principal component (PCA) space. This helps in reducing the system to two dimensions therefore; helping in visualization of clusters is easier.</p><div id="link-10">
