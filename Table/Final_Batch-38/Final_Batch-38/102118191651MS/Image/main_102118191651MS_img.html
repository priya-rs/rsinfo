<p id="Ancr2">Depending on the solid concentration, the product undergoes secondary treatment i.e. thickners for higher solid concentration and Activated Sludge Basin for lower solid concentration. The thickened sludge enters digester followed by centrifuge stage where the product is dried and then sent for land application. The simplicity of the slurry injection technique allows the slurry to be fed into the injection well after the initial processing step (i.e. filtering/screening large chunks of solids, plastic etc) irrespective of the treatment stage it is in during the wastewater treatment process as shown in Figure 1. This is cost effective as the slurry does not have to go through each stage in the treatment process to produce dry biosolids.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">It is also estimated that by applying the slurry injection technique, the city of LA has the capacity to eliminate nearly 600,000 metric tons of CO2 equivalent emissions each year, along with over 2,000,000 truck miles each year. Moreover, no significant seismic activity was recorded during injection operations at this site as shown in Figure 2, which demonstrates that biosolids injection does not create any significant change in the seismicity of the area.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">This is similar to the diageneses process that naturally deposited organic layers undergo over time after deposition. For example, as demonstrated at the biosolids injection facility in Los Angeles, upon exposure to the high temperature (~125°F) of the deep geologic formation, biosolids decompose into CO2, CH4 and other non-volatile residual solids (Bruno et al., 2000). The CH4 will be trapped in the formation to be available for production and beneficial use depending on the need and economic justification. Additionally, due to high formation pressure, the CO2 is partially preferentially dissolved into the natural formation brine, with the remainder acting like a liquid in supercritical state. This results in both a separation of the CO2 from the CH4 and a sequestration of the CO2 in the formation (Bruno et al., 2005). Figure 3 shows the schematic of a biosolids injection process.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Growth faults were developed at the site of maximum deposition due to the rapid loading of deltaic and strandplain sands onto previously deposited shelfmuds. Large thick sections of sand were accumulated due to the growth faults and caused isolation of sand bodies from porous updip sands (Bruce, 1973). During early Oligicene, the Vicksburg formation of the Gulf Coast was deposited, it lies below the Oligocene Frio formation and above the Eocene Jackson Group. The deposition of thick sand layers during early Oligocene makes Frio and Vicksburg formation as potential injection formations and permanent place for injected waste.

The deltaic flanks and associated shore zone and barrier system are responsible for this depositional environment. The interbedded shale layers acts as containment layers for injection in Vicksburg formation and the Anahuac formation on top will be an additional containment formation.

<p id="Ancr7">The geology in northern coastal area of Gulf of Mexico, specially focusing in the Houston area is almost flat. The slurry injection study is conducted using the well data from the well located ~25 miles from the targeted area, but the analysis can be used for different areas of the Houston due to its less complicated geological history. The comparison of Gamma Ray logs across different areas of Houston shows similar lithological trends (with well C in the targeted area and well D in the area of study) as shown in Figure 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">According to the Texas Administrative Code SECTION 331.42, the Area of Review (AoR) (except those wells authorized to inject only nonhazardous desalination concentrate or nonhazardous drinking water treatment residuals) is an area determined by a radius of 2 miles from the proposed or existing wellbore, or the area within the Cone of Influence (CoI), whichever is greater. The area around the injection well within which increased injection zone pressures caused by injection of wastes would be sufficient to drive fluids into a USDW is the cone of influence (Texas Administrative Code §331.2). Figure 7 shows the area of review across 69th Street Plant which is the targeted location for planning an injection site.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">This local in situ stress is a function of the Minimum Horizontal Stress (MHS) (for deep formations) and formation pore pressure. The wireline well logs of oil and gas wells located near the area of investigation were used to calculate the opening pressure for the Frio and Vicksburg formations. This pressure is used for conducting hydraulic fracture simulation study in the injection formation. The geomechanical analysis was conducted using a commercial log analysis software (@LogTM) for the well log data from well in the area of study as shown in Figure 7. The detailed result of the analysis is presnted in Figure 8.</p><div id="link-8">
