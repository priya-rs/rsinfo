<p id="Ancr5">Figure 1 illustrates the solution of qD for PSS model under constant BHP with different ω and λ values and reD = 50, without skin factor or wellbore storage. The plot clearly demonstrates flow in fracture, transition period, and combined flow. The interporosity model requires more time to deplete the reservoir compared with a homogeneous case (ω = 1). Interporosity mass transfer coefficient λ dominates the flow at later period, while, for early time, tD and ω are in the control. The value of λ will not affect production rate for the homogeneous model.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 2 shows the dimensionless rate vs. dimensionless time for transient slab model. Production from fracture system in early time has the same behavior as the PSS case; however, there is no constant production period at later time. This difference can be used as a quick determination of whether PSS or transient model is applicable.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 3 is the dimensionless rate solution obtained using transient sphere model. The production declines are much slower than the slab model although they have the same parameter values. For different sets of ω and λ, the production rate varies obviously at beginning and then converges together at later period. λ influences the production in early time instead of later period.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 4 shows the effect of reD on dimensionless production rate for transient slab model with a constant ω and λ. It is obvious that with larger reD, more time is needed to deplete reservoir and production rate will be higher. This is consistent with field observation that high SRV yields high flow rate.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">Study of well testing has revealed that the characteristic pressure derivative dip in PSS model is not often observed in field data (Figure 5), which means transient interporosity model is more applicable to tight formation than PSS model (Ozkan 2012). For the same reason, this paper will focus on transient model application in production rate-time data.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">A synthetic dual-porosity model was set up to validate above algorithm and the main input data is summarized in Table 1. Different grid size and different matrix permeability, as shown in Table 2, were utilized in order to simulate transient state and PSS respectively. A vertical well was producing at a constant flowing BHP located in the center of the reservoir. The diagram of this synthetic example is shown in Figure 6. For well constraints, we used a minimum BHP of 3500 psi, which was above the bubble point pressure in the model so that oil was the only mobile phase in the reservoir.</p><div id="link-6">

As illustrated, the pressure in Figure 7 declines with time, while, pressure is in a linear relationship with time in Figure 8.

<p id="Ancr13">Figure 9 presents the production rate-time from numerical simulations on a log-log plot. In both simulations, the oil production rate declines rapidly at first. However, for one case, the production stabilizes at a constant rate over a long time and then starts to decline again while the other one keeps declining. This suggests that transient state and PSS are observed in the two simulations. The matrix pressure at the boundary of the reservoir is then investigated for each case to solidify this statement.</p><div id="link-9">
