<p id="Ancr1">Figure 1 shows the distribution of ESP failure indicators as observed on an operator's horizontal wells in the Permian. Excessive heat, most frequently caused by a combination of gassy slug flow and solids production, account for over 50% of ESP failures. Slug flow along the horizontal intensify the abrasive action from sand production. Solids are transported along the horizontal with wave mechanics shifting a solids "sand dune" with each slug and accumulating at the heel of the well where pumps are commonly positioned.

<p id="Ancr2">The system is a mechanical system comprised of three main components: a HEAL Seal, a sized regulating string (SRS), and a HEAL Vortex Separator (see Figure 2). The SRS has a sized internal diameter and length specific to the reservoir pressures and anticipated production rates over the well's life cycle. The system is designed to minimize operational risk and maximize reliability, with no moving parts and does not extend into the horizontal. Flow from the horizontal is conditioned through the SRS and delivered to the Vortex Separator where the cyclonic effect of the Vortex Separator efficiently separates gas and solids from the liquid while discharging to the well's annulus. Separated gas rises up through the annulus. Separated oil, water and solids exit the top of the Vortex Separator, go back down where fluids turn the corner and are drawn back up the Vortex Separator in the crossover path and delivered to the pump (see inset in Figure 2). Solids are intentionally dropped out into the sump. (Kimery, Jensen, &amp; Saponja, 2016)</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The potential to effectively manage gas interference is desireable, particularly in the Permian field. The Permian Basin is a sedimentary basin in the western part of Texas and southeastern New Mexico of the United States (see Figure 3). It is comprised of three basins: Midland Basin, Delware Basin and the Marfa Basin. The Permian is the most prolific producing area in the United States. As of December 2016, the Permian region produces upwards of 2.1 million barrels of crude per day (U.S. Energy Information Administration, 2016).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The system installed in this application is shown in Figure 4 below. The major components of the HEAL System described above (Figure 2) are the packer providing the seal (noted in Figure 4, item 4 below), the Sized Regulating String (item 7), the HEAL Vortex Separator (item 10), and the ESP (item 18). In order to maintain the efficient separation of gas from liquids, the ESP was encapsulated in a shroud. The Vortex Separator discharges the gas to the annulus and intakes the liquids into the bottom of the encapsulated ESP. The liquids flow past the motor section to provide cooling and then enters the intake section.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 7 shows the downhole ESP parameters for Well 1. As can be seen, PIP reduced smoothly and continuously until around 800 psi. At that point, typical signs of gas interference appeared. The use of Proportional Integral Derivative control mode and gas purge cycles, typically used to protect the ESP from gas interference did not improve downhole conditions. Both ESPs failed prematurely.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">In the instantaneous gas chart for Well 1 shown in Figure 8 below, we can see that the gas rate varies from 400-600 mcf/d. Figure 9 shows the critical rate plot for the configuration in Well 1 based upon the Turner criteria (Turner, Hubbard, &amp; Dukler, 1969). From the plot, it is expected that the PIP cannot drop below a certain value without the onset of liquid lifting past the pump. When this occurs, liquid cannot fall back to the pump and builds in the annulus, simultaneously starving the pump of liquid.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">This Operator initially completes all wells on ESP to capture the high initial production rates prior to switching to rod pumping to access the long tail of lower total fluid production rates. ESP life is a major issue for this Operator, with typical pump life between 3 and 9 months. When ESPs fail before the rate drops into the rod pumping envelope, a "wedge" of production is deferred as the well is pump-limited at a lower production rate rather than achieving a smooth, continuous decline from the ESP production period. The goal of the second field trial was to improve ESP life and to achieve a lower PIP than in previous installations. In this application, the system was installed at initial completion rather than in an existing producer as in the first field trial. Figure 10 illustrates the configuration for Well 3 of this second field trial.</p><div id="link-10">
