<p id="Ancr6">Incorporating all the learnings from detailed laboratory evaluations and the successful polymer flood pilot, the full-field polymer flood started in November 2014. To integrate the EOR scheme with the ongoing water injection, the ramp-up strategy was to down-space each of the inverted 9-spot water-flood patterns (450 m spacing) of the upper Fatehgarh group (FM1 and FM2) to five spot polymer flood patterns (250 m spacing) by drilling additional injectors and replacement producers (at the location of previous injectors) (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

Ammonium bisulphite was dosed at different concentrations in the Thumbli water to scavenge any oxygen that may ingress. This option did not show much improvement in viscosity measurements of wellhead samples. Initial observations of providing nitrogen blanketing showed improvement in measured viscosities (Figure 4).

Table 4 shows the initial injectivity of a few polymer injectors with baseline water injection and polymer injection.

The injection rate measurement can be crosschecked from the surface and simulated rate match from the spinner survey analysis. Figure 9 shows the match of M-182 injection bottom-hole pressure. With an established injection rate of 3,900 Bpd (surface rate matched with simulated rate) at an ITHP of 410 psi (stable during spinner survey), viscosity of the polymer solution was adjusted to match the recorded injection bottom-hole pressure of 1828.4 psi.</p><div id="link-9">

The radial flow region in the polymer injection case is at a higher pressure than the previous baseline case.

<p id="Ancr15">Numerical simulation techniques were also used in order to establish in-situ viscosity estimates. For this purpose, an FM-3 layer polymer injector was used in order to avoid inherent uncertainities with fall-off interpretation in multi-layered system. As already discussed, the FM-3 layer is relatively homogeneous with little variation in permeability and thickness. As part of regular surveillance, fall-off tests were done with water injection and polymer injection. These injection bottom-hole pressures were matched in a commercial simulator, both for water injection and polymer injection. This again confirmed that the insitu viscosity of polymer solution is in the range of 15-20 cP for a 2,500 ppm polymer solution. Figure 11 shows the results from actual fall-off tests and from the numerical simulator.</p><div id="link-11">

A pre-planned schedule for the data gathering was prepared, effectively executed, and actively discussed every month to capture all areas of the field for pro-active saturation monitoring. Deeper layer injectors and other wells that allow access to the shallower layers are used for saturation monitoring. The spread of wells across FM1 and FM2 levels in which saturation monitoring is carried out is shown in Figure 12.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr21">The production performance of producers that are relatively close to polymer injectors has shown very good improvement in terms of increasing oil rates and declining water cuts. The mobilization of additional oil by polymer bank over water flood is also visible in time-lapse fall-off tests and saturation monitoring surveys. The saturation monitoring surveys have shown re-saturation in parts of the reservoirs due to sweep improvement from polymer flooding. Polymer flooding has also helped in achieving improved conformance as compared to the waterflood in parts of the field, thereby improving injection performance. The oil production rate within the area that has had the maximum amount of polymer flooding (central FM1) to date has increased by nearly double in the last quarter, and it is still on an increasing trend, as shown in Figure 17.</p><div id="link-17">
