<p id="Ancr4">In order to adjust the original/initial choke model parameters, 1600 observations are collected consisting of separator and DST testing data points, where the wells are producing at a series of different stabilized critical flow rates at different chock sizes, Table.1. The Basic Sediment and Water (BS&amp;W) is almost equal to 5 percent for all the measurements. The gas-condensate production platform under consideration is located in the Persian Gulf offshore and contains twelve deviated wells. The well production streams pass through adjustable surface chokes and then mix together. The inclination and Measured Depth (MD) of the platform wells range between 3.0° to 70°, and 3000 to 5000 m, respectively. Within the range of wellhead parameters investigated here, the choke size varies between 24 and 68 (1/64 in.). The frequency of each choke opening is depicted in Fig.1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Around 70 percent of the input data is used for training the model, 15 percent for validation, and the remaining is reserved for testing the model accuracy. The final network architecture for both gas and condensate production rates contains three variables in the input layer, eight neurons in one hidden layer, and one output. The prediction errors are listed in Table.2, and the predicted versus measured gas and condensate rates are depicted in Fig.2. The minimum prediction errors are associated with the neural network modeling, and hence we use the trained network as the original data-driven model through the platform production allocation process.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">In this section, well flow allocation of an offshore gas-condensate platform is conducted over 420 days of the field production life. The platform consists of twelve wells and the total platform production together with wells’ operational parameters (shut-in/flow pressure, temperature, choke opening, annulus pressure, etc.), sea-line and compressors’ parameters, and information of the test separates are continuously monitored. The wellhead pressures and the sea-line upstream and downstream pressures are depicted in Fig.3. The choke openings are plotted in Fig.4, and Fig.5 illustrates the wellhead temperatures. The average reservoir pressure is very close to the dew point pressure. The well deliverabilities are different and dynamically changing, and CGR is extremely variable between well to well and over time.</p><div id="link-3">
