<p id="Ancr2">Junggar Basin is located in northwest China (Figure 1a), Jimusaer Sag is located in the eastern uplift of Junggar Basin, Jimusaer County, Xinjiang (Figure 1b). The whole is a long-term negative sedimentary unit and formed at the end of Carboniferous. It is characterized by a dustpan depression with low-lying east to the west, area is 1278 km2. Jimusaer Sag experienced the influence of late Hercynian, Indosinian, Yanshan and Himalayan tectonic movements. The scale strength and influence of different tectonic movements are different. The Lucaogou Formation of the Permian is distributed in the whole sag with a thickness of 200-350 m (Figure 1c).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">As shown in Figure 2, the static brittleness index obtained by experiment and the dynamic brittleness index obtained by experiment calculation are displayed in the form of cross plot. The correlation between them is very poor. At the same time, the data points are far away from diagonal, so the numerical value is very different. Therefore, the dynamic brittleness index cannot be used to express the static brittleness index directly, but it can be used to calculate the static brittleness index. Through the analysis of the experimental data, it is found that the relationship between static and dynamic parameters is greatly affected by the rock matrix and pore, so the ratio of static brittleness index and dynamic brittleness index is constructed, and found that it has a good correlation with porosity and clay content, as shown in Figures 3 and 4.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">In order to test the effect of static and dynamic transformation of brittleness index, the relationship between static and dynamic brittleness indices before and after correction is analyzed, as shown in Figures 2 and 5. Compared with Figure 2, the data points in Figure 5 are concentrated near the diagonal line, and the correlation is very good, which shows that the corrected static brittleness index is in good agreement with the experimental results and the reliability of the model is good.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The laboratory rock mechanical experiment is carried out by the rock triaxial stress apparatus. Due to the difference of composition and structure, the deformation mechanism of rock is complicated. The stress-strain curve of rock can be classified into three types (Figure 6). Low porosity sandstone and limestone are typical brittle rocks, which are considered to be better in petroleum engineering and linear in stress-strain curve, as shown in Figure 6(a). The failure occurs before the large nonlinear deformation, the mode is brittle failure, it is the occurrence and development of micro-fracture.</p><div id="102118191934MS-Img_SPi-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Based on the rock mechanics characteristics and fracture morphology, the 85 experimental results in the study area are divided into three types: good brittleness, medium brittleness and poor brittleness, drawing static brittleness index and Poisson's ratio cross plot, as shown in Figure 7, When the static brittleness index is more than 85 and Poisson's ratio is less than 0.2, the reservoir shows good brittleness, when the static brittleness index is less than 40 and Poisson's ratio is greater than 0.24, the reservoir shows poor brittleness. When the static brittleness index and Poisson's ratio are between them, the reservoir shows moderate brittleness.</p><div id="link-7">
