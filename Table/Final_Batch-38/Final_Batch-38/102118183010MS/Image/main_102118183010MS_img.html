Injection of 1.1 pore volumes of water was followed by 4 pore volumes of polymer injection. Then, chase water and a second polymer slug was injected. The incremental oil recovery factor of polymer flooding compared with waterflooding was 12 % for a polymer concentration of 1000 ppm. Polymer adsorption was 4.5 mg/100 g rock, the residual resistance factor 1.5, the Inaccessible Pore Volume 0.3 and the in-situ polymer solution viscosity 7.5 cP.</p><div id="link-6">

The breakthroughs of the tracers in the surrounding wells are indicated in Fig. 7. The oil cut of three wells S65, S66 and S95 increased as response on polymer injection and polymers are producedback from the three wells. For S66 and S95, the oil cut increases almost at the same time as polymers could be detected. The oil cut response of S65 was prior to polymers breaking through at the well.

The 8 TH reservoir was produced by edge water injection. The blue line in Fig. 10 indicates start of injection into the converted S81 well. Following this conversion and water injection, the oil cut was increased. At the same time, the water salinity showed the response of the injected water.
