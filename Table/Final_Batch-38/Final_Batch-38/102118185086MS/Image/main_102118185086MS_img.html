<p id="Ancr4">The Morrow B sandstone reservoir is at a depth between 7550 ft and 7950 ft subsurface with an average dip of less than one degree (Figure 1). Maximum burial depth has been determined to be approximately 10,800 ft; maximum depth at the time of deformation was 4265 ft and the minimum depth at time of deformation estimated at 980 ft (Gragg 2016). The productive limit of the FWU extends laterally to about 8300 acres. The maximum pay thickness is 54 ft with an average of 22 ft. </p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">An additional 6 water injector wells drilled during this period. The initial sensitivity analysis performed on primary and secondary recovery processes showed that well bottomhole pressure (BHP_PROD), oil-water contact (OWC), fault transmissibilities and bottomhole injection pressure (BHP_INJ) were the most important parameters (Figure 4). These uncertain variables were included in the history matching process to optimize the objective function at acceptable data uncertainty ranges.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 5 shows oil production and water cut profiles. Various waterflood patterns swept to residual oil saturation of about 27%, a successful flood. This is not unexpected given the relatively good mobility ratio of about 1.6 and high injection throughput of at least 1.7 displaceable pore volumes. From the simulation results, nearly 6 MMstb represents 10% of OOIP produced prior to the initiation of waterflood. A total of 25.65 MMstb of cumulative oil has been produced at the end of secondary from the west half of FWU, which represents nearly 40% of OOIP.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Vectors such as gas production and injection rates were unable to match after the CO2 breakthrough which could be attributed to a potential changes in wettability and interfacial tension. There is a possibility of the Morrow B transitioning into a mixed-wet wettability system. Corey parameters were adjusted to improve calibration of the CO2 flood history match. An optimization approach was utilized to identify optimum values for Corey parameters. Optimum values for example Corey oil-gas = 1.366; Corey oil-water = 6 resulted in an acceptable history match. Figure 6 shows simulated results compared to historical oil production, gas production, gas injection and water production profiles.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">This case showed a gradual increase in oil production from simulation run start until early 2017. The production from this case plateaued at 2750 Stb/d in late 2019 before it gradually declined, as shown in Figure 7. The gradual decrease in oil recovery could be a result of increasing gas-oil ratio. The cumulative oil production was good with an incremental oil recovery of a little over 19% during the CO2 flood period (Figure 7). The increase in recovery is also due to the effectiveness of water injectors adjacent to the CO2 flood patterns sweeping a high percentage of the zones that were left unswept at the end of the water flood. The good result could also be attributed to the use of low salinity water (about 500 ppm) which could alter the reservoir to a more water-wet condition.</p><div id="link-7">
