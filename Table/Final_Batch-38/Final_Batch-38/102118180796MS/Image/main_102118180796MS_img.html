<p id="Ancr6">The Trinidad and Tobago offshore energy focus is shifting towards deeper waters, since most existing fields in shallow water are currently being exploited. The past bid rounds by the Ministry of Energy and Energy Industries have focused primarily on deepwater blocks, as illustrated by the Deepwater Block Energy Map in Figure 1. Should the ongoing drilling campaign prove fruitful, subsea infrastructure and processing will become much more attractive at these water depths exceeding 1,000 meters.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">The Highlander Project in the North Sea in 1985 involved the installation of the first subsea slug catcher and caisson separator. Subsea production from a ten (10) well subsea template at 420 ft water depth was tied back to the Tartan "A" platform. The chosen configuration, displayed in Figure 3, allowed full throughput from the low energy field without causing upsets due to severe slug flow, and without increasing topside weight.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">The SEPUMP design, shown in Figure 4, consists of a horizontal ESP installed inside a slug catcher, with the intent of creating a pump-based separator that can function as a slug catcher. The two-tier system allows the gas and liquid to separate into the different tiers that are joined via cross branches, allowing flow between the tiers. The gas and liquid can then be sent to topside separately for processing.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">The WAVy design, illustrated in Figure 5, is similar to the SEPUMP with the additional capability of sand separation from the well fluid. It consists of multiple branches forming a ‘W-A-V’ geometry where denser liquids settle to the bottom and gas flows out of the top of the separator. Sand accumulates at the bottom and is removed via a flush line and pump.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">The concept of spherical separators was recently developed and patented to allow for a low maintenance, continuous separator capable of efficiently separating oil and water from water containing oil. The original patent for a cylindrical design was expanded to fit into a spherical shell capable of withstanding the hydrostatic forces in ultra-deepwater applications (Janjua, 2013). This design is illustrated in Figure 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">With successful separation of produced water, the focus shifts to monitoring and analyzing the effluent to enable continuous discharge at the seabed. Currently, there are no subsea produced water discharge sensors commercially available. A joint industry project (JIP) was created to develop this novel technology, and this has progressed to the current bench-scale testing phase. A high level description of the development phases is given in Figure 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr14">The Light Scattering technology utilizes the principles of absorption and diffraction of a light beam in the near infrared (IR) spectrum. These phenomena are caused by the bean crossing oil particulates in the water stream. The logarithmic relation between the straight and diffracted beams measured by the sensors is proportional to the oil concentration in the sample. This principle is illustrated in Figure 9.</p><div id="link-9">

Images are captured in rapid succession (25 times per minute), with any droplets or solids detected by software analysis of the digital image.

<p id="Ancr16">Output data is based on a fixed frame count which translates to an output of ppm oil-in-water. Data captures are large enough to provide reliable data and fast enough to provide either continuous batch outputs every few minutes or rolling outputs instantaneously. Due to the different appearances of oil droplets and solids, the sensor is able to produce a more accurate reading than equipment that cannot distinguish between oil and solids, as illustrated in Figure 11.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr17">The LIF sensor developed for produced water analysis monitors oil-in-water concentrations at a high range of temperatures and pressures. The schematic is shown in Figure 12. A laser emits ultraviolet light onto the process via fiber optics. When in contact with oil, the emitted fluorescence is collected, transmitted, filtered and quantified by a light sensor. An inline probe inserted directly into the pipe allows for real-time measurement.</p><div id="link-12">
