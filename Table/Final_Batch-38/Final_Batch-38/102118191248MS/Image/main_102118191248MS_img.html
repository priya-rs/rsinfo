<p id="Ancr3">It is the product of the reactivation of pre-Cretaceous faults, transient movements and the intrusion of igneous bodies, which in conjunction gave the genesis to this geological structure. Located in the foredeep of the Oriente Basin with coastal and transitional delta and estuary deposits. The Drago Complex is an elongated anticline with preferential direction N-S product of compressive stresses. The main reservoirs are the U and T sandstones, Fig.2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The accuracy of the study can only be proved by the performance of the wells once the jobs are executed. During the development of the Drago Complex, a great amount of information was collected to characterize the different reservoirs. With this great amount of data collected over the years, a known methodology was applied using the corporate software to collect, organize, standardize and turn data into information as shown in Fig. 3, (Consentino, 2001). Once the information was organized and structured, a comprehensive workflow was used to define the opportunities of incremental oil production, (Ruano, 2014).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The application of PTA on this study was focused on production engineering i.e. the individual well (Spivey, 2013). Various tests were evaluated on each well to obtain quantitative updated values of permeability, skin and reservoir pressure. The methodology used is described by Izurieta (2015). Results from this evaluation showed that most wells in the field had a high skin, which was not deep enough to be removed with conventional approaches such as re-perforating or matrix acidizing, Fig. 4,therefore a more appropriate remedial or stimulation technique must be used (Spivey, 2013).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The next step on the workflow was to review well log data, both open hole and cased hole. To achieve this goal all conventional and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) logs were loaded in the corporate database. Logs were environmentally corrected, well tops updated and petrophysical evaluation was calibrated with core data (Bateman, 2012). The permeability was derived from methodologies like Winland R35 or global hydraulic elements (Corbett, 2007). Along with NMR, carbon/oxygen logs and this updated interpretation, new pay zones and additional pay intervals on known reservoirs were identified as shown in Fig. 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Because of the deep penetrating nature of the damaged region present on the studied wells, hydraulic fracturing was selected as the appropriate technique to restore well productivity.

<p id="Ancr13">The decision tree shown in Fig. 12 highlights the possible scenarios during workover planning that helped to maximize NPV. This project used historical information and aimed to take new information to evaluate the productivity increase in each case, i.e. value of information, (Kamal, 2009). In some cases, the information showed a high risk for the project, at this point the asset team had the possibility to make an informed decision as to whether the project should bedropped or the workover should be re-designed according to the new data and if the risk was still favorable to production, the project should continue.</p><div id="link-12">
