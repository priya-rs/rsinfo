Deviated wells D1, D2, and D3 in the center of the pilot area have good cold production that was attributed to extensive fracturing. This fracturing satisfies the primary criteria for the FIM trial.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">A type log for the Rubble stratigraphy is shown in Figure 6. In the FIM trial area the Rubble reservoir is about 48 feet thick with fairly consistent reservoir matrix properties (skeletal wackestone with 22% porosity and 3.5 mD permeability). A few thin layers within the Rubble have enhanced permeability due to karst dissolution. The overlying Blue Shale is about 40 feet thick and an effective seal. However, the argillaceous limestones between the Rubble and underlying Limestone-2 (LS2) and Ostracod formations are only one to two feet thick and commonly fractured.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">The horizontal wells were allowed to soak before being produced together along with the deviated wells. In cycle 3, steam was injected in all 6 horizontal wells simultaneously while in cycle-4, only 4 horizontal wells were injected into. The cycle design (volume of steam, soaking and production times, injection configuration) as well as the well spacing were all reservoir simulation driven. Figure 7 and Table 5 summarize the four cycle designs.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr13">The intention in all cycles was to inject pre-defined volumes of steam to build up the system pressure. The pressure build-up was capped at 1000 psi to prevent further fracturing of the reservoir or extending existing natural fractures. A slow injection pressure build-up was noticed in all four FIM cycles. Figure 8 illustrates the pressure build in cycles 1 and 2. Similar behavior was noticed in cycles 3 and 4.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr14">The DTS profile (Figure 9) of well H2 confirms that the majority of the injected steam volumes are entering the extensive fracture system. An additional possible cause for slow pressure buildup is loss of steam into the underlying Ostracod reservoir. As mentioned earlier, there is no effective seal between the Rubble and the Ostracod. Furthermore, 3D seismic and wellbore image logs show that faults and fractures cut across the two reservoirs.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr15">In the fourth FIM cycle a different injection configuration was used. Steam was only injected in the four horizontal edge wells H1, H3, H4 and H6. Although a similar volume of steam flooded the same fracture system a slower pressure build-up was recorded when compared to the previous three cycles, as illustrated in Figure 10. This could be due to wider injection well spacing, lower injection rates per well, or greater pressure depletion of the fractures.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr16">A steep pressure drop has been observed in all four FIM cycles during the soaking period as shown by Figure 11. When injection ends on day 3, downhole pressure drops from around a 1000 psi to less than 400 psi in only 3 days of soak. Such a steep drop in pressure may suggest leakage in which injected fluids escape out of the system (most probably to the underlying Ostracod).</p><div id="link-11">

Comparing the downhole temperature between cycles 3 and 4 at the same cumulative liquid produced, the reservoir downhole temperature in cycle 4 is approximately 20°F higher than the preceding cycle's temperature (Figure 13).

<p id="Ancr20">The DTS temperature profile of well H2 shows that the fracture systems dominate the flow in the production phase as they did during steam injection. The temperature is highest at the fractured zones as shown in Figure 15. It is believed that as steam is injected into the fracture system, heat transfers from the fracture face to the adjacent matrix, increasing the temperature of the matrix and its occupying fluids, and causing them to thermally expand and be expelled out of the matrix.</p><div id="link-15">
