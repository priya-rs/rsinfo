Figure 3 shows the Julia #2 log and pre-job fracture modeling. Figure 4 shows a quarter segment of the model with bars showing the permeability distribution and resulting pressure field during production. Despite some higher permeability streaks, simulations showed large consistent drawdowns and production could be acheived across all the pay intervals. In other words, the high permeability streaks did not overpower the lower permeability at ultra-high drawdowns.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">A geomechanical model as shown in Figure 8 was built for each well using sonic log data to generate elastic properties. Triaxial, UCS and Brazilian Testing (indirect tensile strength) were performed on sand and shale plugs to calibrate the log-generated dynamic properties with static elastic properties. Preliminary schedules were developed using exploration well logs and offset well data to determine the approximate amount of proppant and gel required for each zone.</p><div id="link-8">

Bottomhole gauges were run in the bundle carrier as well as along the washpipe. Post-job fracture modeling was performed using the bottomhole gauge data. The initial fracturing pressure and net pressure growth were matched by making adjustments to the geomechanical model and using gel rheology provided from onsite testing.

(Please see Figure 12.) Reverse out pressure was calculated to ensure the backside stayed overbalance to the frac and kept the proppant/gel mixture out of the wellbore fracturing sleeve back to the service tool.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr14">First oil production at Julia field began in April 2016 with a single producer as shown in Figure 14. The second producer followed in May 2016. With only two producers, early field production peaked at about16,000 bbls/day. Starting in early 2017 production rates were optimized based on surveillance of near wellbore depletion estimates from short build-ups. At this time, one producer's rate was curtailed to mitigate what was deemed to be too large of a near wellbore depletion pressure. In September and November of 2017, the third and fourth wells came online, increasing field production. At present, Julia is producing over 25,000 bbls/day, with a cumulative production of approximately 10 million barrels.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr15">A component of Julia production optimization includes surveillance of near wellbore drawdown (total drawdown) and PTA (pressure transient analysis) derived completion performance (i.e., skin) for all wells. Initial pre-drill estimates of Julia well skins were −2 to −3. To date, actual Julia well skins are nominally−5 at the onset of production (Please see Figure 15). The integrity of each well's skin appears robust with repect to both time on production and total drawdown pressure.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr16">To capture all the geomechanical compaction and shear effects that affect the completion, geomechanics based finite element analysis (FEA) was applied to model the reservoir and tubular deformation behavior under well-specific producing conditions. A parametric study of geomechanical loading and tubular resistance was conducted to create a general WOL response surface that can be applied to any well in minutes, and summarizes the current WOL application procedure (Grueschow et al. 2008). The output of the WOL calculation is a graph of drawdown vs. depletion with the corresponding limit state indicated graphically, shown in Figure 16, and thus indicates the limits of drawdown-depletion to avoid well failure.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr17">The two main failure mechanisms were determined to be compaction failure and shear failure. WOLs were calculated for each individual well, taking into account the local rock mechanics of each well path and the specific completion type. The DC101 well was executed as a frac pack completion, with the top zone not being fractured due to an operational decision. (Please see Figure 17.) Note that the shear failure WOL is the limiting factor in this case, governed by the unfractured top zone, and indicates that the well can be safely drawn down to approximately 10,000 psi at 0 psi depletion. Figure 18 shows WOL results for the JU104 well with a successfully executed frac pack in all zones. However, due to the uncertainty of achieving a fully packed annulus, both compaction and shear WOLs were honored.</p><div id="link-17">
