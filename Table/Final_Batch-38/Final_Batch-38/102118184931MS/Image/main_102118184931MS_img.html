<p id="Ancr1">During the oil production in mature fields, the implementation of water flooding projects plays an important role for increasing the oil production and the recovery factor of the reservoirs, and this is the case of the Golfo San Jorge Basin in Patagonia Argentina (GSJB). This basin, located in the central Patagonia (Figure 1), is the oldest productive basin of Argentina where the first economic discovery took place in 1907 in Comodoro Rivadavia. With 13.973 active oil wells (Jun 2016), Golfo San Jorge is the first oil producer basin of Argentina producing 251.000 bpd of oil (49 % of Argentinian oil production) and 3,2 MMbpd of water.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The basin is essentially asymmetric; in the eastern section the dominant extensional faults are on the northern flank with the southern flanks being a less faulted, flexural type margin. In contrast, the western section is asymmetric but its major faults are on the southern flank, being the northern flank a flexural margin. The central section of the San Jorge basin is dominated by NW and NNW trending extensional faults that were reactivated by compression in Tertiary times (Figure 2)</p><div id="link-2">

In some cases, the water is separated in these facilities and derived to treatment plants. Once in the treatment plants, the water is conditioned and distributed through pumps to the water injectors wells.</p><div id="link-5">

Regarding to the percentage of production participation by different recovery, 46% of the total production of oil is from secondary recovery, 53% by primary and 1 % from EOR. (Graph 2). With respect to oil production from the EOR, we could say that it is incipient but will be key to increase the oil recovery factor and improve the efficiency of the sweeping of the injected water. Accompanying this evolution, we find that the percentage of water currently reaches 92.7% with an incremental rate of 0.3 % per year during the last 6 years (Graph 3).</p><div id="link-8">
