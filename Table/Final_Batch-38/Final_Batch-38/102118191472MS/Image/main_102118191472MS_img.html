<p id="Ancr5">For this work, the full-field model was converted to a compositional model using the Equation of State (EOS) model provided by the operator. A sector model subsuming the pilot location was generated from the calibrated full-field model as shown in Fig. 1(a). In this step, we retain the native vertical and areal grid resolutions in the pilot model, as well as the calibrated pore volume multipliers obtained from the full-field history matching (Olalotiti-Lawal et al., 2017).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">We follow a two-step hierarchical approach for the calibration of the pilot model (Yin et al., 2011) as described in the general workflow schematic in Fig. 2. In the first step, we focus on a global update of spatial distribution of the model permeability field and the relative permeability functions. We apply the Grid Connectivity Transform (GCT) which enables spatial updates of the permeability field using a small set of basis functions (Bhark et al., 2011). In the second step, we fine-tune the pilot model permeability field by matching CO2 arrival times at the producers using the streamline-based Generalized Travel Time Inversion (GTTI) algorithm (Cheng et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2004; He et al., 2002).</p><div id="link-2">

For model permeability field updates, a set of orthogonal basis functions Φi obtained by an eigen-decompostion of the grid connectivity Laplacian is utilized. A few of these basis functions are shown in Fig. 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">The results show a close agreement with the initial relative permeability function, which was obtained from the full-field model calibration (Olalotiti-Lawal et al., 2017). In fact, looking at the comparison of the relative permeability functions between initial and updated model in Figs. 5(a) and (b), it turns out that the oil-water relative permeability functions are retained from the full-field model, while the gas-oil functions are modified. It can be recalled that the field data integrated into the full-field model was predominantly based on a two-phase oil-water system. This justifies the preservation of the oil-water relative permeability function.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr19">In Figs. 15 (a) and (b), visual comparisons of the CO2 plume between the initial and updated models at the beginning and the end of CO2 injection are provided. In all the plots presented, the plume shape was obtained at a threshold value of 0.3 CO2 model fraction. The preferential flow of CO2 towards PRD4 earlier discussed can be visually confirmed in Figs. 15 (a). As discussed in previous sub-sections, the CO2 fingering in the initial model resulted in earlier CO2 breakthrough and hence, unfavorable CO2 sweep compared to the updated model response. Also at the end of CO2 injection, as shown in Figs. 15 (b), CO2 never flowed towards PRD3 due to the poor hydraulic connectivity with INJ in the initial model.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr20">The Lorentz curve shown in Fig. 16(a) shows a plot of the flow capacity F as a function of the storage capacity Φ. The 45-degree line typically mimics a piston-like displacement and the geometric area enclosed by this line and the Lorentz curve gives the Lorentz coefficient LC. Large values of LC indicate higher flow heterogeneity and therefore, less tracer sweep efficiency. A reduction of LC from 0.75 in the initial model to 0.64 in the updated model, with a corresponding 20% increase in tracer sweep efficiency (Fig. 16(b)) was deduced at from the analyses. The updated model shows much better flow connectivity compared to the initial model.</p><div id="link-16">

As expected, CO2PVI shows a positive trend with OilRF but an opposite trend with CO2UF. Higher values of CO2PVI causes more mobilization of residual oil. Going by the definition in Eq. 20, higher OilRF in turn, causes the desired reduction in CO2UF. From Fig. 18, calculated sensitivities for WAGRATIO appear to disagree with common field observations.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr24">We considered four types of correlation functions including linear, exponential, Gaussian and cubic functions in the construction of the proxy models (Lophaven et al., 2002). These proxy models were validated with 50 blind parameter combinations sampled within the bounds of the parameter space. These results of the proxy model validation are presented in Fig. 20. These figures show crossplots of numerical simulation responses versus proxy model predictions of both OilRF and CO2UF for all correlations functions. Clearly, the constructed proxy models shows good agreement with numerical simulation results for the blind parameter combinations. The proxy model based on the linear correlation function resulted in the best fit and therefore, was chosen for the CO2 WAG optimization.</p><div id="link-20">
