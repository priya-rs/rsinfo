<p id="Ancr1">The service company has been working with the operator since 2010. The operator is known as one of the oil and gas operators in Indonesia adopting low-tier service in their operation. It has a second exploration well (L-2) in the L field located in Seram Island, Maluku in the eastern part of Indonesia, known for its extremely harsh drilling challenges (Fig. 1). This second exploration project plays a great role for the operator because it will help determine the continuity of the drilling operation in this area.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">This well is planned to be drilled in five hole sections—26 in, 17½ in, 12¼ in, 8½ in, and 6 in. The most challenging section is the 8½-in section. This section would be drilled through the lower part of the Upper Nief Formation, Lower Nief Formation, Kola Shale, and top of the Manusela Formation (Fig. 2). Harsh drilling conditions are expected, such as potential packoff while drilling through the interbedded clay in the Upper Nief Formation, very hard carbonates in the Lower Nief, and chert nodules in between the two (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">This section would also encounter the fractured-carbonate Manusela using high mud weight. This means that the interval drilled in this fracture carbonate needed to be minimized to avoid severe losses. Hence, geostopping was critical to help set the casing point at the top of the Manusela (with maximum ~10ft penetration of top of Manusela). Moreover, this section would also have very narrow window between formation pressure and fracture gradient of the lithology encountered. Thus, real-time monitoring of mud weight was to be updated accordingly within narrow margin ([1]2 lbm/galUS) is required in this section (Fig. 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Hydraulics simulation (Fig. 5) shows that the point-the-bit RSS had a lower pressure drop among other directional tools and would create the least standpipe pressure of all the configurations. The standpipe pressure issue cannot be accommodated by either a mud motor or push-the-bit RSS because the pressure drop required by both technologies is larger and leads to higher standpipe pressure, which will fall beyond the maximum rig mud pump limit.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">BHA dynamic simulation is intended to compare the vibration behavior of different initial BHA designs. Taking the static modeling result, three different BHAs were compared in combination with the previously selected drill bit. Dynamic simulation takes detailed cutting structure design into consideration. Therefore, different bits will generate different dynamics. Fig. 12 shows the final BHA that was simulated, with drive system as the major distinguishing component.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">Dynamic simulation result showed that BHA 2b (the point-the-bit RSS BHA) generated lower vibration compared with the motor BHA, making it more stable (Fig. 13). Drilling system stability is important as it will preserve the bit and BHA longer in the hole, potentially increasing ROP and drilling footage while reducing the number of trips required. Therefore, based on the simulation result, the RSS BHA was recommended for this particular application.</p><div id="link-13">

The objective of this stage was to give a guideline of drilling parameters window to be applied in the field. Based on a specific threshold, three vibration modes were classified into two major categories—low and high. Any vibration value exceeding the threshold will be flagged in various colors depending on vibration type. The simulated parameters sensitivity plot is shown in Fig. 14.</p><div id="link-14">

The service company successfully delivered the service for drilling the 2,770-ft interval in 14 days, which is 12 days less than the expected time (AFE motor). Overall, this section was drilled 18 days faster than the previous well (L-1) despite the L-2 section being 28% longer than L-1. Furthermore, there was also an improvement in the number of runs, which was reduced by 50% from four runs in L-1 to two runs in L-2 (Figs. 15 and 16). Such performance was translated into 18 days spread cost saving (USD 2,673,000) for the operator compared with the previous well and 12 days spread cost saving (USD 1,782,000) compared with AFE days.</p><div id="link-15">

The smooth 7-in liner run in this well was contributed by a smoother borehole condition, as a result of enhanced drilling stability. Utilizing the correct combination of the RSS BHA and 7-bladed bit and applying correct drilling parameters are two key factors to achieving drilling stability and, in turn, reducing tortuosity and generating a smooth borehole. Fig. 17 showed the vibration trend throughout the run with no significant continuous shock and vibration recorded downhole.</p><div id="link-17">
