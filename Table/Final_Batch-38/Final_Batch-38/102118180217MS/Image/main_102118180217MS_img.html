<p id="Ancr1">Back in 2013, the authors began to evaluate production response in an area of north-east Weld County, where nearly 50 Niobrara wells were completed by a single operator, using a similar completion design for all wells. Figure 1 shows the wide variation in production results after 180 days of production, ranging from 4 to 16 barrels of oil equivalent per lateral foot, a 4-fold change in production across these 50 wells.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Only since 2014 do we see a significant change from that approach with a new focus on a reduction in cost per boe. Figure 2 shows the general trends in several key completion parameters between 2009 and 2015, with most parameters showing a fairly tight band for initial DJ development, while more radical design changes appear in the last two years.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Figure 3 shows four examples, also listed in bullet format below, of such properties for a select area of the DJ Basin in north-east Weld County. These parameters were chosen as examples to spatially show how the geologic/reservoir/petrophysical parameters change over a given area and how spatially coincident they may or may not be with production results. The production bubbles on each map represent 365-day cumulative production in boe per lateral foot, from the Niobrara formation only.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">In an effort to make strong multivariate models, and compare wells with similar geology, five DJ Basin study areas were defined, as shown in Figure 7. Boundaries were defined using several key pieces of data, including gas-oil ratio (GOR), oil gravity, and spatial distribution of wells.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">This sparse data set does not lend itself to a rigorous multivariate statistical analysis, and therefore is not included in any production or cost sensitivity modeling. Despite the small data set, simple bivariate analyses are still valid, and valuable insight can be gleaned from them. Figure 8 shows two bivariate plots looking at completion parameters versus 365-day production. There are clear trends, with strong R2 values, that show a positive impact on production for both increased proppant amounts and frac fluid volumes.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">The multivariate results for one example study, the Niobrara in NE Weld County, are shown in Figure 9. The production model uses a total of six parameters. Three are driven by the completion design (stage intensity, frac fluid volume and average proppant concentration) and three are related to reservoir quality (TVD, HPV, and water cut). The tables in Figure 9 show the relative sensitivity of each parameter – for example, a 42% reduction in stage spacing from the dataset average of 217 ft down to 125 ft increases production by 17%.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The multivariate results for the remaining four study areas are presented in table format in Figure 10, which shows the production sensitivity of all independent completion and petrophysical parameters. As such, each column represents a simple linear regression model that can be used to forecast production. For example, 365-day cumulative production in the Inner Core Wattenberg Niobrara increases by 0.009 boe/ft for every lbs/ft increase, while a 1% increase in water cut reduces production after 365 days by 0.28 boe/ft.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">For example, as shown in Figure 11, a 16% increase in fluid volume in NE Weld Niobrara wells (from 16.6 to 18.8 bbl/ft) may increase the frac cost by about 5.5%, while it increases the total well cost by only 0.9%.

<p id="Ancr12">Figure 12 shows the typical cost for all these areas to increase 365-day or 180-day production by 10%. The results in the table shows that there are no _silver bullets_ for the most economic production improvements in the DJ Basin – the solution to improve production in the best possible way is not the same everywhere. In Inner Core Wattenberg, the better and higher GOR wells in the DJ Basin are helped more by placing more proppant. This focus on conductivity may also indicate that higher-quality proppant might do better in this area.</p><div id="link-12">
