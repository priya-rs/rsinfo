<p id="Ancr3">In the study area, the thickness of single mouth bar sand-body is from 2m to10m. According to the above formula, the length of single mouth bar sand-body varies from 3.1km to 5.3km and its width is from 1.5km to 2.6km. Under the constraint of this quantitative scale, the single mouth bar in S oilfield is identified, combined with the identification mark of single mouth bar and the sedimentary model (Figure1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The outcrops and modern deposition studies indicate that multi-stage accretions develop insiden the single mouth bar. These accretions successively prograde towards lake and sea, forming single mouth bar. LEEK (2005) studied the outcrops of Wyoming in the United States (Figure 2). As shown in Figure 2, there were five stages accretions in the interior of single mouth bare, and the accretions were superimposed in foreset type.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Based on core observation, grey and off-white argillaceous, or argillaceous sandy interlayer develops in mouth bars in the study area. The electrical characteristic of the interlayers is that natural gamma and resistivity curves obviously returns. And the thickness is about 0.3m to 1.5m, with an average of 1m. Thus, typical cored wells are selected to identify the interlayer in the single mouth bar. Through the electrical parameters calibration of the interlayer, the interlayer logging response template is established for the study area (Figure 3). Then the interlayer and sand-body architecture unit is explained with the established logging interpretation template.</p><div id="link-3">

The profile analysis revealed that the bottom of the accretion is flat and the top is protuberant. After the formation of first-stage accretion, the later accretion presents as arched shape because of the upward protruding shape of the bottom and the radians gradually decreases from the bottom to the top. The uplift amplitude of the sand body in the study area varies from 1m to 2m and the width of interlayers ranges from 150m to 600m (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-4">

The length of the mouth bars is 3.1km to 5.3km. The width of the mouth bars is1.5km to 2.6km. The thickness of the mouth bars is 2m to 10m. In the parallel source direction, the scale of the interlayer is 200m to 1000m and the dip angle is 0.4° to 1.0°. While in the vertical source direction, the scale of the interlayer is 150m to 600m and the dip angle is 0.4° to 1.0° (Figure 7a,b).</p><div id="link-7">
