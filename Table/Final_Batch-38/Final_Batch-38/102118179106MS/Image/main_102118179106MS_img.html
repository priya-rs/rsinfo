<p id="Ancr1">Wattenberg field of the Denver Julesburg basin, Colorado as shown in Figure 1 (Sonnenburg, 2002) isone of the largest overpressured, basin-centered oil and gas fields within the Rockies in terms of total proved reserves, areal extent, and number of wells drilled. Discovered in 1970 by the drilling of a vertical well into the Dakota “J” sandstone, Wattenberg continues to be one of the most active fields currently in the country, despite almost continuous oil and gas development throughout the last 45 years.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">As shown in Figure 2, fault throws encountered were on the order of ~50 feet. The primary target for these five wells is the Niobrara “C” chalk bench as shown in Figure 3 which is a type log from an offset vertical well. Wells I and L were landed in and stayed in the lower “C” chalk bench for most of the lateral but had a toe-up design in the second half of the well, ending in the lower “B” chalk bench. Wells J and M were planned in the lower “C” chalk bench and stayed there flat throughout the entire lateral. The Well-K was drilled in the middle “C” chalk bench and stayed flat in the middle of the chalk until the graben where it contacted the “B” chalk before ending up in the lower part of the “B” marl.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">A step-rate test was performed before each stage in Well-L except stage 1 where no divertor was applied as a precautionary measure. The results from the step-rate test were then applied to a proprietary algorithm to determine the amount of environmentally friendly divertor to be pumped. The main objective of this diversion process is to ensure uniform distribution of the proppant near-wellbore as shown in Figure 6, instead of the path of least resistance taking off the entire treatment. The example shown below is from an actual pilot well with intra-stage diversion in few stages. The tracer log confirms the intra-stage diversion representation.</p><div id="link-6">

A maximum proppant concentration of 4 ppg was pumped in this stage and the model treatment data agrees well with the actual data without any calibration from the fiber-optics diagnostics results. The proppant distribution in lbm/sq.ft from this limited entry treatment is shown in Figure 8. The proppant distribution scale varies between 0 and 1 lbm/sq.ft. The justification for adding a longitudinal component to the model came from several other fiber-optics diagnostic results in the DJ basin. The history match analysis shows some perforations not getting any treatment. This could be due to several reasons including stress shadowing from other two clusters.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">Coiled tubing deployed fiber also provides an alternative for deviated/horizontal laterals when compared to wireline deployed fiber-optics. The rigidity of coiled tubing also provides protection to the fiber-optic cable when deployed. The coiled tubing deployed fiber-optics provides DTS and DAS data along the length of the coil or the wellbore once deployed in a well. This technology can also be utilized to evaluate acid treatments, observe inter-well communication during treatments, leak detection and finally as a production log. Memory mode pressure and temperature point gauges can also be run as a part of the BHA of coiled tubing, to gain better understanding of flowing pressure. Figure 12 provides a schematic of this technology.</p><div id="link-12">

Figure 14 describes the various fiber-optics sensing techniques that are currently utilized. The techniques range from a single point sensor (providing temperature and pressure point measurement at the end of the fiber optic cable) to an array of point-sensor measurements for strain and temperature, to a fully distributed sensing setup where the entire length of the fiber becomes the sensors.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr15">Thus, when deployed in wellbores either via coiled tubing or permanent installation, fiber-optics provides a unique method of surveying the entire wellbore at the same time. Fiber-optics technology utilizes analysis of backscattered light from the fiber glass. Figure 15 shows the various components of the backscattered light. Temperature, Acoustics and Strain information can be inferred by analyzing these components of the backscattered light. The intensity of the Raman component of the anti-stokes band is temperature dependent, and stokes band is non-temperature dependent.</p><div id="link-15">
