<anchoringText id="Ancr3">Another important objective of the study is to create a workflow to quickly identify candidate wells to be converted to injectors. The developed workflow was implemented using Petrel platform allowing for various field data integration and industry reference simulator ECLIPSE. The main stages of the workflow can be seen in Fig. 1. Most steps of the workflow are automated, which makes it easily applicable to the company's other assets when decisions has to be taken in short timeframe. Quick injection candidate identification workflow is very relevant and applicable to PKKR JSC other assets.</anchoringText>

Fig. 6 displays moderate to good correlation between porosity and permeability. Also on the same cross plot one can notice that single values of porosity may have corresponding permeability values that differ up to 100 times (i.e. Poro=0.1 and Perm=0.1 to 10mD). It provides us with an extra degree of freedom during the model history matching phase.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">From the comparison of the computed and log derived water saturations one can determine the free water level as well as enhance the capillary pressure model. Our observation is that this approach is more comprehensive and yields better results compared to simplified default method of deriving water saturation from capillary pressure curve in simulators. Fig. 7 proves that this comprehensive approach gives accurate match in water saturations interpreted from logs and used in dynamic model.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr13">Waterflooding assessment started from analyzing the pressure distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 3, which shows pressure map of the RP field for May 2016, the greatest pressure drop is observed in the vicinity of the wells 12 and 2. It is not surprising to see such pressure decline in those areas as it is linked to the highest total liquid producers. Apart from pressure map, current mobile oil map was analyzed to see areas that could potentially benefit from injection (Fig. 11).</anchoringText>

For that purpose based on table 2 two best injectors were identified and extension of those vertical injectors with two horizontal laterals was modeled. Chosen injectors for lateral extension can be seen in Fig. 16. Azimuth for the horizontal section was optimized based on multiple scenarios. Simulation run with only two horizontal injectors showed increase in oil production, but additional recovery was not superior to the case with 5 vertical injectors, which is seen in Fig. 15.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr21">Therefore it was essential to estimate the risks associated with ‘misjudgment’ in connectivity of the reservoir arising from underlying uncertainty related to the input parameters of the base case model. To examine the stability of the forecasts, a series of equiprobable realizations with deteriorating connectivity was tested. Changing geostatistical parameters such as variogram ranges allowed to repopulate the model producing different flow patterns while leaving the reserves intact. As can be seen from the Fig. 19, reduced connectivity indeed has a negative impact on the recovery coefficient.</anchoringText>
