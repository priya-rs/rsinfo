<p id="Ancr3">Another important objective of the study is to create a workflow to quickly identify candidate wells to be converted to injectors. The developed workflow was implemented using Petrel platform allowing for various field data integration and industry reference simulator ECLIPSE. The main stages of the workflow can be seen in Fig. 1. Most steps of the workflow are automated, which makes it easily applicable to the company's other assets when decisions has to be taken in short timeframe. Quick injection candidate identification workflow is very relevant and applicable to PKKR JSC other assets.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">On the well level we observe similar behavior. Fig. 4 displays how well 12, second highest producer in the field, experiences significant pressure and production decline in a short timeframe. Moreover, shutting the well for some period did not help and pressure did not build-up to the initial value. Decline curve analysis constructed for RP wells based on Arps' method (Arps, 1945) predicts further production rate loss in wells, which will eventually lead to wells not making up their economic oil production limit (Fig. 5). Last but not least, it has to be mentioned that current recovery factor of the field is as low as 4.7%.</p><div id="link-4">

Also on the same cross plot one can notice that single values of porosity may have corresponding permeability values that differ up to 100 times (i.e. Poro=0.1 and Perm=0.1 to 10mD). It provides us with an extra degree of freedom during the model history matching phase.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">From the comparison of the computed and log derived water saturations one can determine the free water level as well as enhance the capillary pressure model. Our observation is that this approach is more comprehensive and yields better results compared to simplified default method of deriving water saturation from capillary pressure curve in simulators. Fig. 7 proves that this comprehensive approach gives accurate match in water saturations interpreted from logs and used in dynamic model.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">DCA forecasted oil rates were used as input into the simulator for prediction runs and in such a way operating bottom-hole pressures for the future were forecasted. That created a prediction scenario which included all producers continuing their production at the current state with no pressure support and with no actions to wells or field. Wells are automatically closed when they reach economic oil production limit of 0.7 m3/day. In the following steps all of the simulation results will be compared to this base case.

<p id="Ancr13">Waterflooding assessment started from analyzing the pressure distribution. As can be seen from Fig. 3, which shows pressure map of the RP field for May 2016, the greatest pressure drop is observed in the vicinity of the wells 12 and 2. It is not surprising to see such pressure decline in those areas as it is linked to the highest total liquid producers. Apart from pressure map, current mobile oil map was analyzed to see areas that could potentially benefit from injection (Fig. 11).</p><div id="link-11">

During 20 years of prediction simulation, no considerable effect on incremental oil production, subsequently, recovery coefficient is seen in Fig 13 where case names refer to active injector wells in particular model. Main reasons are most likely low connectivity in the area which is slowing down the speed of injected water, few thin sand layers, and long distance between injectors and producers.</p><div id="link-12">

Selected wells for that particular run are shown in Fig. 14. Increasing number of injectors up to 5 resulted in more positive response from the reservoir and incremental oil recovery was greater than all other cases. While, 3 injectors inside each pattern region mainly give support to producers around them, potential injectors 128 and 230 support particular wells that are inside this injection scheme but at the same time located further in distance from their respective injectors.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr18">Based on works done by Huang et al. (1995) and Cao et al. (2014) possibility of drilling horizontal lateral and injecting through them was assessed as well. For that purpose based on table 2 two best injectors were identified and extension of those vertical injectors with two horizontal laterals was modeled. Chosen injectors for lateral extension can be seen in Fig. 16. Azimuth for the horizontal section was optimized based on multiple scenarios. Simulation run with only two horizontal injectors showed increase in oil production, but additional recovery was not superior to the case with 5 vertical injectors, which is seen in Fig. 15.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr21">Therefore it was essential to estimate the risks associated with ‘misjudgment’ in connectivity of the reservoir arising from underlying uncertainty related to the input parameters of the base case model. To examine the stability of the forecasts, a series of equiprobable realizations with deteriorating connectivity was tested. Changing geostatistical parameters such as variogram ranges allowed to repopulate the model producing different flow patterns while leaving the reserves intact. As can be seen from the Fig. 19, reduced connectivity indeed has a negative impact on the recovery coefficient.</p><div id="link-19">
