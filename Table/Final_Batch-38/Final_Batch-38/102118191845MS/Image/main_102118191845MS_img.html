The interfacial tension represents the fluid-fluid interaction between the surfactant solution and the oil; therefore, different oils exhibit different interfacial tensions with the same surfactant solution. The results of the interfacial tension analysis were combined with those from the Amott oil recovery tests (Figures 2a and 2b). Amott test results were normalized against the highest performing surfactant, which was MFS in both cases.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">Although pressure transient analyses (PTA) are extremely helpful in characterizing well performance, understanding the rock-fluid interaction requires the use of other diagnostic plotting techniques. Again, we turn to the simple but novel harmonic-decline semi-log plot. The flowback oil rate versus flowback cumulative oil (Cum Oil) and gas rate versus flowback Cum Oil are plotted in Figure 5. By extrapolating the decline of the oil rate along the x-axis, the maximum load fluid recovery can be estimated.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr14">Figure 7a depicts the Cum Oil produced from an 11-stage "plug'n perf" well in the Duvernay formation. The well was initially designed for 24 stages but the remaining stages were not completed due to mechanical liner issues. The well was subsequently shut-in for 201 days for evaluation purposes. During the initial 11 stages, 13,742 m3 of water was pumped using a weak surfactant (NE) at a loading of 1.0 L/m3. Since formations such as the Duvernay have low irreducible water saturation and do not exhibit mobile water, as load fluid recovery increases, the hydrocarbon curve should approach a vertical asymptote. In this well, water blockage appears to have limited the oil production of the well. Injecting the water with NE provided only a moderate reduction in IFT, resulting in poor hydrocarbon production and load fluid recovery (Figure 7b).</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">Early in the development of the East Duvernay, some level of surfactant loading was deemed necessary to complete the large volumes of slick water treatments required for enhanced oil recovery from this nanodarcy, oil-wet formation. Figure 8 shows a Cartesian plot of multiple wells completed in the Eastern Duvernay Basin treated with different surfactants ranging from microemulsions (ME) to non-emulsifiers (NE). The plot compares Cumulative Load Fluid Recovery to Cumulative Hydrocarbon Liquid Production. The stage count between wells varied from 12 stages during early development to beyond 40 stages in later years.</p><div id="link-14">
