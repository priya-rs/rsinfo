The base strategy consists of 8 producers and 6 injectors, all vertical wells with both top and bottom regions completion. The location of the wells and drilling sequence are illustrated in Figure 2a. These wells are operated by maximum injection pressure and production capacity with set shut-in criteria (Table 1) during 20 years of operational period. We start with a base plan designed to maximize recovery by placing producer in the oil rich region and placing injectors at periphery of the oil water contact to maximize sweep efficiency in the entire oil zone.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">Due to the large uncertainty in subsurface models, wide spread is observed in cash flow. Low oil in place and recovery models end up with negative cash flows during all operation period, while majorities of runs ends up with positive NPV after 20 years of operation. The average of the NPV S-curve from ensemble of models is positive, approximately $300MM. The S-curve shown in Figure 3 is used as a base objective function, and our target is to improve this by selecting decision parameters.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The number and location of the platforms for the offshore asset is one of the important factors as it affects drilling cost and time (Tables 1-2). Figure 5 shows the drilling cost estimation for different radial distances from the base platform location. Estimated cost is $10MM for vertical wells under platform, then increases linearly as distance increases. The base platform location is shown in blue circle, and four additional locations (white circle) are selected as potential candidates for alternative platform locations. The selected locations are based on maximum of $50MM drilling cost for covering regions above oil water contact.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">As platform locations are parameterized, well locations and trajectories will be parameterized next. Figure 6 shows the parameterization technique used to determine candidates of the well locations. The x-y coordinates of the well locations at contact depth of the reservoir are discretized by Archimedes spiral shown in left side of Figure 6a. By utilizing Archimedes spiral, distance between wells can be controlled by two parameters. This approach provides several advantages in practical well placement and drilling strategy. For example, locations are not discretized by grid index (i,j,k) system but geographic coordinates system, which leads to a flexible design for wells under any type of gridding system. In addition, distance from platform increases as well identification number (ID) increases enabling engineers to understand the well design intuitively. For instance, well IDs 1~10 are near platform while IDs 100 and greater are far from platform and closer to oil water contact in Olympus field, requiring longer drilling time and larger cost.</p><div id="link-6">

In Figure 7a, several wells were removed from the list of candidates defined by Archimedes spiral shown on Figure 6b. Several criteria are used to select or eliminate potential well locations: wells must be located in reservoir domain, producers must be located above oil water contact, and new locations must not be near existing wells. Once potential infill well locations are defined, optimizer will activate the wells to achieve optimized objective, as demonstrated in Figure 7a-b.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr13">We will next show parametrizations of well trajectories and completion types. The completion strategy depends on reservoir geometry, structure, and rock type. In Olympus field, there is an impermeable shale layer disconnecting top fluvial sand and bottom low permeability layer. Considering this, selection strategy will be completing both top and bottom layers for vertical or slanted wells but completing the horizontal wells to target the top high conductive fluvial channel. Figure 8 shows the example of vertical, slanted and horizontal wells shown in red, yellow and blue colors, respectively. The slanted and horizontal wells include three different length and angles. With that, a total of 19 types of completion designs are defined per well candidates</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr14">Figure 9 illustrates two examples of the development designs: Scenario A for 8 wells with equal number of producers and injectors, and Scenario B for 10 wells with more producers than injectors. In scenario A the field is developed by placing two injectors first, then recursively placing two produces followed by two injectors during a period of one year. In scenario B in contrast, there are more wells compared with scenario A but with different producer and injector drilling pattern, leading to longer time to complete the field development. It is worth mentioning here that well location and completion type will be assigned on top of the drilling sequence, for instance, define the first injector location as x with a completion type of y, then the second well will be z with completion type w, as demonstrated in Figure 9.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr15">The sensitivity analysis is conducted for the one platform scenario and the ranking of the correlation coefficients between parameters and objective function (e.g. NPV) is shown in Figure 10. Negative and positive correlations are shown by red and blue bars respectively. In this example the sensitivity analysis shows that fraction of injector and well locations have the highest impact on the NPV. Negative correlation of the fraction of the injector with respect to NPV suggests that more producer should be recommended for the Olympus field development. Following the fraction of injector, the 1st to 6th well locations are ranked accordingly by their impact on the NPV. As shown in Figure 6, negative correlations in the well location parameterization strategy suggest that first couple of wells are preferable to be drilled near platform (i.e. NPV decreases as well IDs increases).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr16">The binary parameter interaction map for the decision parameters in the Olympus field development application is shown in Figure 11, where red crosses indicate interaction (conditional effects) between the corresponding parameters when performing significant statistical testing. All the decision parameters have interactions except platform location and well economic shut-in criteria. This shows a highly ill-posed problem and thus non-gradient based approach will be potentially suitable with simultaneous optimization of the decision variables. Additional observation is that the optimization of the decisions such as platform location and the well shut-in economic criteria may be done sequentially since significant test indicates small interaction for these parameters compared with other decisions.</p><div id="link-11">

The tuning parameters for the optimizers are customized to find global optimum, with trial and error through the initial run. Total of 5000 simulation runs, 50 samples in decisions parameter space extending to 100 generations were executed for all optimizers. Here the objective is to maximize NPV from P50 oil in place (OIP) geologic model with 20 years of the field operation.

Because each proposed field development design will generate three NPV outcomes, the objective is to improve the mean of the NPV assuming that each realization has equal probability. The convergence speed and final NPV S-curve are compared with those yielded from single realization run. The best development design will be selected after conducting 50 samples with 100 generations (total 15,000 simulation runs due to 3-realization models) and compared the performance with single realization results.

<p id="Ancr19">Instead, the approach developed here is not to include all the model realizations in the optimization process at once. It will be more practical to incorporate more model realizations sequentially during the optimization. This approach will save computational load significantly, while capturing the range of uncertainties in several stages (i.e. sequentially refines S-curve in subsurface uncertainties).

<p id="Ancr23">Figure 18 illustrates parallel computing speed-up factor and scalability of the optimization time using cloud. Figure 18a demonstrates scalability of single simulation runs for several real field simulation models (indicated by number of grids), and the blue line shows our Olympus reservoir simulation model. We have observed that simulation run time speed up factor increases by 10 times using 16 cores and start decreasing after 64 cores parallel run. Considering these observation, the optimization run times required to complete 50 samples in decision space, with 100 generations are compared in Figure18b with varying number of geologic models (from 1 to 15 realizations).</p><div id="link-18">
