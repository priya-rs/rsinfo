<p id="Ancr4">The honeymoon is over and the ‘lower for longer’ oil price environment has forced some field operators to announce their intention to cease production, which will have a significant impact on the available hub facilities and infrastructure for future developments (Figure 1). Last year, UKCS operators announced that only 5 fields were ceasing production, but it is estimated that over 50 fields would enter the so-called ‘lighthouse mode’ to avoid having to pay the imminent Abex, by continuing to operate at a loss (Wood Mackenzie, 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">A typical large integrated oil field layout is shown in Figure 2 to illustrate the scale of a North Sea decommissioning project. It takes on average 3 to 4 years from cessation of production (COP) to abandonment completion, but this is expected to lengthen as larger developments are decommissioned. Based on the current oil price environment, it is forecast that over the next decade over 150 UKCS fields are forecast for decommissioning, with over 100 platforms being completely or partially removed, almost 2000 wells P&amp;A’d, and 7500 km of pipeline decommissioned.</p><div id="link-2">

The estimated cost of this complicated and challenging task is US$22 billion (£17.9 billion), with a breakdown given in Figure 3, with half being for wells’ P&amp;A and 53% of the total being spent in the Central North Sea (Oil &amp; Gas UK, 2016).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">Recent tax changes may encourage new investment in the North Sea, or at least, persuade operators to continue lossmaking operations in the short term to prevent early field COP. However, if no further investment materialises, there could be a domino effect (Figure 4) of fields ceasing production in this mature region, leading to an acceleration of D&amp;R, and signalling the demise of much of the UK oil and gas industry (OGA, 2015).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">The UK government recognises the need to balance safeguarding the taxpayer with the objective of MER; and its published risk based approach sets out the framework used to determine the most appropriate risk mitigation. The five-step flowchart shown in Figure 5 describes how to choose between risk mitigation via the financial strength of the group of section 29 holders who have joint D&amp;R liability being considered sufficient to meet forecast Abex, or by the existence of a DSA between partners in the group with sufficient funds to meet D&amp;R costs (DECC, 2011).</p><div id="link-5">
