<anchoringText id="Ancr2">This case had more than 500 wells in less than a 5 mile radius on similar dip with no known faults in the area. This geological uniformity allowed a fair comparison of performance vs. completions. Figure-1 is a multi-variable plot. The colors indicate the different years the wells were completed in. The Y-axis is a normalized scale, going from minimum to maximum, for each variable on the X-axis. The labels (numbers) on the plot indicate the value corresponding to that variable on the X-axis. The included histogram highlights the well count for each color (year). There are more than 70 wells targeting this geology in each year. This assures good well control.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr3">Upon first look this project did not stand out as economic. It was very difficult for the reservoir engineer to be bullish on this acreage, especially, when there were twice the number of sub-economic wells than the super-economic wells. However, being able to understand and delineate the factors affecting performance, the engineer can make a sound judgement on what the well performance would be like, going forward. Figure-2 indicates the stark divergence in the type-curves for different years. 6-month cumulative production is known to be a good indicator of EUR.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">Figure-3 shows another prospective area where the well count is limited to less than 50. There are two different operators with two very different completion strategies targeting the same depths in the same bench. It is difficult to determine which factor influenced the production the most - stage length, proppant or lateral length. Figure-4 shows the disparity in type-curves for the two operators targeting the same landing depth, in the same bench, in the same area, with varying completions strategies. The incremental EUR for operator-1 over operator-2 was almost 200,000 BOE, with 100 ft shorter stages, 100 ft longer lateral lengths and double the proppant amount.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr6">Figure-5 illustrates a case where a relationship was identified between fracture fluid type and production. The choice of fracture fluid also dictates the amount of the fluid that will be used and the rate at which fluid will be pumped into the system. In this particular case, the wells stimulated with slickwater fracs performed 56% better than the gel fracs in terms of 6-month cumulative production. The slickwater fracs also used 1200 gals/ft as compared to 768 gals/ft for gel fracs.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">Figure-8 highlights the effect that the orientation of the well can have on production. The color code is assigned on the basis of orientation angle of the wellbores. The N-S (green) and E-W (Red) wells targeted the same depth 9,900 ft. The E-W wells were not only longer laterals but they also utilized larger proppant jobs as compared with the N-S wells. In spite of this the N-S wells performed 42% better in terms of 6-months production.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr10">Referring to Figure-9, bench-2 was targeted the most. According to the investor reports on operators active in this area of interest, Bench-2 is richest in Kerogen/TOC. Bench-3, although not so rich in kerogen had a higher frackable rock content. Bench-1 had the lesser percentage of both frackable rock and TOC. Comparison of production vs. completions, indicate the three benches are more or less similar with Bench-3 outperforming the other two by 20% in terms of 6-month production BOE per lateral foot in spite of smaller frack jobs.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">The case (Figure-10) mentioned here is on structural dip with an average dip rate of 60 ft/mile South to North. The survey and section lines are oriented North-South. The minimum stress orientation is also N-S. Hence, an N-S or S-N wellbore orientation is optimum. The best area in the target zone has a thickness of less than 40 ft. This implies, in order to stay in the zone it is safest to either drill the well toe-down or toe-up along structural dip.</anchoringText>
