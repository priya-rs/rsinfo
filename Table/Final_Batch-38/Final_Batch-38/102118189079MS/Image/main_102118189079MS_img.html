<p id="Ancr4">The A4 reservoir is a shallow anticlinal structure that is bounded by two main faults. An internal fault divides the reservoir into two fault blocks: Main and West fault blocks. The two fault blocks share a common OOWC and are also connected in the down-dip oil leg. No OGOCs were logged by the wells that penetrated the reservoir rather Highest Known Oil (HKO) were encountered (see Figure 1)</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The comprehensive simulation of A4 reservoir involved the use of a structured workflow for the simulation project (see Figure 2). First, the earth models with static uncertainties were created by the geologist. The earth models are reviewed by the engineer to ensure that the static data were consistent. Then, the engineer reviews the historical production/injection/pressure data and quality checks the data to identify any erroneous and inconsistent data. Thereafter, the engineer reviews the dynamic input data before carrying out deterministic history-match</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Each of the above static properties has their low, mid and high realization values. Thus, there were 243 realizations of earth models. The dimension of the earth model is 64 × 102 × 41 (I × J × K); while the average dimension of each grid block is 45m × 45m × 1.5ft. The total number of active grid blocks in the base model is about 81,000 grid blocks. With this low number of active grid blocks and considering the fast run time for the model, there was no need to upscale the model. Thus, the model used in this work is the original fine grid from the geologist. Figure 3 shows fine grid of the base model.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">In addition the test/allocated GOR are inconsistent with the FTHP except at early production time. Thus, it was decided that only the initial produced GOR for A4-1p will be considered for history match as far as GOR match is concerned. However, the allocated oil rate, shut-in bottom-hole pressure, FTHP and water cut for all the historical production period of A4-1p will be history matched (see Figure 4). The A4-2p well has good consistency between the well test oil rate and allocated oil rate. However, the allocated GOR is more consistent with the FTHP compared to the well test GOR. It was decided to consider all the allocated GOR history of A4-2p for history match. In addition, the allocated oil rate, FTHP and water cut for all the historical production period of A4-2p will be history matched (see Figure 5).</p><div id="link-4">
