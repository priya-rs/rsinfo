<p id="Ancr1">The Raudhatain field (Fig. 1) lies within the Arabian basin in the northern part of Kuwait and is located in a typical desert terrain at elevations ranging from 130 to 215 ft, encompassing a surface area of about 30 sq. miles. The field produces from both clastic and carbonate reservoirs of the Early Cretaceous age. It was ranked as 18th among the largest known oil fields of the world by Halbouty et al. (1970) and 27th by Carmalt and St. John (1986).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Major oil accumulations are present in the upper part of the Mauddud Formation carbonates, in sandstones developed within the upper and lower sections of the Burgan Formation, and in sandstones developed within the upper and middle sections of the Zubair Formation (Fig. 2). Oil accumulations are also present in more limited porosity developments within the upper and lower shale sections of the Zubair Formation. The upper reservoirs of the field in the Mauddud and Burgan formations are separated from the lower reservoirs of the Zubair Formation by the porous to cavernous but nonproductive dolomitic limestones of the Shuaiba Formation.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Sand-laden fluids can be used, or cavitating jets may be required. Jet pressures range from a few hundred psi to 60,000 psi in some cases (Surjaatmadja, 1998). The hydrojet (or hydrajet, when sand or another abrasive is used) tool shown in Fig. 4 concentrates high-power energy on its target created by the fluid jetting action. Fluid is forced from a jetting tool through a small orifice into the annulus. Pressure in the jetting tool must be higher than the pressure in the annulus. The fluid's high-pressure energy within the tubing is transformed into kinetic energy, resulting in high-velocity fluids, as per Bernoulli's principle. The velocity inside the jetting tool is generally low, less than 50 ft per sec.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The pumping rate through tubing was adjusted to 12 bpm in order to meet the required pressure drop through the pinpoint stimulation tool nozzles. The pumping rates were adjusted to achieve the required dilution and acid strength of 15% HCl downhole and combined bottom hole (BH) rate to create adequate fracture geometry. Fig. 7 illustrates three stages of the treatment in which average tubing pressure was 3,379 psi, average rate was 10.8 bpm and, in the annulus, the average pressure was 186 psi and average rate was 3.3 bpm.</p><div id="link-7">
