<anchoringText id="Ancr5">From the logging data of drilling wells and the data analysis of rock sample from sealed coring wells, the swept thickness of the reservoir increased by 21.4% (from 68.6% of water flooding to 90% of polymer flooding), and the oil saturation reduced by 11.9% (from 52.8% of before polymer flooding in average to 40.9% of after polymer flooding in average). The oil saturation before polymer flooding was mainly about 40-70%. The oil saturation after polymer flooding was mainly about 25-45% (Fig. 1) [4].</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr6">The oil saturation after polymer flooding was mainly about 25-45% (Fig. 1) [4]. The residual oil distribution after polymer flooding was highly dispersed. The remaining oil in longitudinal direction was mainly distributed in layers on the top of the reservoir and in interlayer. In plane area, the oil saturation was highly fragmented, with relatively rich in bypass line position (Fig. 2)[5].</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">Core flooding experiments: CFS-700 high pressure/high temperature chemical flooding system was used for core flooding experiments (Fig. 3). Based on the development history of pilot formation, the lab physical simulation displacement procedures were made to investigate the effect of chemical injection modes, design of foam slug and ASP slug on displacement efficiency during foam/ASP flooding. The experimental cores were mounted horizontally into a Hessler sleeve. The behavior of injected foam was monitored by camera through a sapphire visual cell before the inlet of core holder.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">Selection of the foaming agents The properties of foam formulation are the key factor to ensure high performance of recovery [7]. Dozens of commercial surfactants (acted as foamers) had been screened by dissolubility tests with formation water firstly. The foam ability and stability were then tested for foamers with good solubility (Fig. 4). From the results of experimental evaluation of comprehensive performance of foamability and foam stability, four foaming agents with good performance though preliminary screening: F3, F6, F10 and F12. By considering the oil resistant and economic properties, F3 was selected as foaming agent forfurther experiments.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">Both foamability and stability for F3 foam system were good. Fig. 5 showed that both the initial foam volume and half-time for dewatering were increased as F3 concentration was increased from 0.05% to 0.6% for bulk foam system. To optimize the experimental protocol (blancing the factors such as foamability, stability and acceptable chemical costs), F3 concentration was determined as 0.4% in following experiments.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr10">Selection of foam stabilizers To enhance foam stability, commercially high molecule polymer such as HPAM, KYPAM, and MO4000 were used as the stabilizer. Remarkable increase in stability was observed for foam system when stabilizer was added (Fig. 6). Half-time of dewater increased from 527 seconds to 1,347 seconds in the presence of stabilizer S1 with concentration of 0.09%. The foam stability enhancement of high molecule polymer may be understood by studying the liquid film separation between neighbor gas bubbles. Stability of foam is closely connected to the stability of film and the foam film should be somewhat elastic to ensure withstand deformation without rupturing.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">Sodium carbonate with concentration of 1.0% was used in ASP system. Surfactant HABS with concentration of 0.3% was used in ASP system. The relationship between ASP viscosity with different polymers and polymer concentrations were showed in Fig. 7. Propotional increasing in viscosity was found for ASP solutions with the polymer concentrations increasing. At the same concentration, KYPAM and FP6040 showed the greater visosifying ability than the others.</anchoringText>
