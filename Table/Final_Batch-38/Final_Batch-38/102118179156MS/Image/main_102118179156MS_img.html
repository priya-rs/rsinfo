<p id="Ancr1">The Bakken-Lodgepole total petroleum system (TPS), as it is called (Fig. 1), comprises the Bakken formation, upper Three Forks formation, and the lower Lodgepole formation, with the upper and lower Bakken Shales acting as the source rocks The play was mostly vertical in the early exploration periods, with vertical wells completed and produced from the Sanish formation in the Antelope field. The first horizontal well was attempted into the upper Bakken Shale in 1987 (Jin et al. 2015).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">There is a large database of conventional wireline logs, cores, and tests covering most areas of the basin. With a mix of thin beds, variable mineralogy, low permeability, and mixed wettability rocks, porosity and permeability relationships in the TPS can be quite complicated. Mineral assemblages within the matrix can include calcite, dolomite, siderite, potassium feldspar, plagioclase, quartz, pyrite, illite, and anhydrite. Kerogen is also present in quantities between 1 and 40%. Measured Archie’s m and n parameters from core vary considerably (Fig. 2), and recent work by Simpson and Fishman (2015) has shed some doubt on existing core permeability measurements in the system.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">A typical petrophysical interpretation and reservoir quality characterization of a Bakken well is shown in Fig. 3. As seen from the log, a combination of high-tier logs is usually required to characterize the lithology and hydrocarbon content of the rock. Enhanced log analysis from openhole elemental capture spectroscopy is used to understand different mineralogy and clay types. Weight fractions of different minerals are then used to estimate water saturation, although this calculation does not differentiate between bound and mobile water. Various published and publicly available m and n values are then used to calculate water saturation as a function of formation water resistivity at different depths.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Planar models built using geomechanical earth models that were calibrated with closures from extended shut-in decline analysis tests have shown that the hydraulic fractures grow considerably in height, well into the Lodgepole formation, and they extend more than 1,000 ft in length. Microseismic studies were performed to investigate height growth and validate predictions from a numerical 3D planar hydraulic fracture model. Fig. 6 shows the microseismic event distribution from fractures initiated in the Three Forks formation that confirm height propagation well into the Lodgepole formation, as predicted by numerical simulation. With respect to length, extension pressure gauges were installed in offset wells 2,000 ft away, and direct fracture interference was witnessed. Fig. 6 also illustrates the fracture pressure inteference between wells.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">Another way of understanding the nature of fracture propagation and contribution to production from the stimulated reservoir volume is to look at production from wells as a function of stage count in the same pad or area. Fig. 7 shows one such example in which 12-month cumulative production from different Bakken and Three Forks wells in the same pad were compared and plotted against the number of fracturing stages from each well. It should be noted that all these wells were completed with plug-and-perf completions using three perforation clusters per stage. The analysis shows that the cumulative production from these wells is directly proportional to the number of fractures propagating (assuming all fracture clusters were propagating and contributing to production).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Fig. 8 shows the effect of fracture parameters on long-term oil production from a Bakken field. As seen in the plot, half-length has a far-reaching impact on well productivity whereas fracture conductivity (shown as a function of type of proppant used) has minimal to no impact on the same. This is because, most of the differences in production resulting from higher conductivity are due to storage effects in the fracture leading to higher initial production as the reservoir and fracture attempt to reach a state of equilibrium. In unconventional reservoirs with very low permeability, the transition from fracture linear flow to bilinear flow to formation linear flow happens in the first few months of production, and thus the overall impact of conductivity on long-term production is abated.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">Reservoir quality, typically characterized by effective porosity, mobile water saturation, effective permeability and net pay, varies throughout the basin as a function of the depositional environment. A plot showing the variation of hydrogen index (HI) from the Upper and Lower shale members of the Bakken formation are shown in Fig. 9. Most of the trends in the indices show a general decrease in total organic content from east to west with decreasing HI and stages of oil generation with respect to HI (USGS 2010). Effective porosity and water saturation determine the volume of oil stored in the pore spaces of the rock matrix, and the effective and relative permeabilities of the rock determine the ability of the rock matrix to flow oil into the hydraulic fractures.</p><div id="link-9">

As seen from the figure, when oil prices trend in the range of USD 40 to USD 45 per barrel, most of these plays become uneconomical to explore and exploit. Although operators are struggling to find different ways to reduce overall well costs and service costs have come down significantly to reflect demand and pricing pressure, most operators have idled rigs and built a huge inventory of horizontal wells that are drilled and waiting to be completed when oil prices rebound and returns on wells that come online improve.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr14">As oil prices keep getting lower, optimum values may never reach a point of inflection, and we start seeing diminishing returns irrespective of the combination of oil prices and number of fracture stages. Optimum well spacing at USD 80 per barrel of oil may be four wells per drilling unit (DU) whereas even six wells per DU may not be optimum at USD 50 per barrel of oil. A functional optimization scenario should take into account volatility in oil prices, as shown in Fig. 14. Not only will provide the operator an opportunity to make meaningful decisions on their drilling and completion strategies but will also offer them a valuable tool to prepare for cyclical fluctuations in oil prices without affecting revenue margins signif-icantly.</p><div id="link-14">
