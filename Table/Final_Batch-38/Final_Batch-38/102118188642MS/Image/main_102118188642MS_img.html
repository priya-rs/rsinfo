<p id="Ancr2">There are three mechanisms responsible for the uneven flux along the wellbore of a horizontal well: drainage, friction, and heterogeneity. Figure 1a shows higher fluxes at the heel and toe of a horizontal well compared to the main wellbore in a homogenous reservoir and the uneven flux grows as time increases (Economides et at., 1996). The phenomenon is depicted in Fig 1b, where the heel and toe are in a radial flow while the main wellbore is in a linear flow. Radial flow gives much larger drainage areas than the linear flow and grows faster (r2 vs. r, r is the drainage radius).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">In an ICD/ICV well, the wellbore is subdivided into several compartments and each compartment is bounded by two packers or the end of the wellbore (Fig. 2a). Packers are used to block the annulus flow from one compartment to another. At least one ICD/ICV with the same nozzle size is installed in each compartment. Compartments are constructed to align with high flux (high water cut) and low flux (low water cut) intervals. A good compartmentalization does not mix high flux with low flux intervals in each compartment. A compartment is constructed such that the flux within the compartment is as uniform as possible. The mechanism of using ICDs/ICVs to improve oil production is to restrict the flow from high flux compartments by using smaller nozzle sizes.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Coupling of a well model (e.g., NETool) with a reservoir simulator is depicted in Fig 3a. The well and reservoir are linked by a graph (a network of nodes and connections). Nodes are distributed in reservoir, annulus, and tubing. Connections link all of the nodes together. There are reservoir, annulus, and tubing nodes and connections. In addition, there are ICD/ICV connections. Solving this network (graph) is time consuming (Al-Shaalan et al., 2017). If we can simplify the network without a significant loss of accuracy, we may solve the efficiency issue.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">In order to test the efficiency of the proposed well management logic approach, a giant carbonate reservoir located in Abu Dhabi offshore, one of the largest offshore reservoirs with an aerial extent of 1200 square kilometers (Khedr et al. 2012), has chosen for the test. More than 300 ERD wells are planned to drill from four artificial islands (Fig. 6,Edmonstone et al., 2014). 370 ICD/ICV wells are chosen to test the efficiency of full field simulation. The results demonstrate that the full field simulations with and without ICDs/ICVs show only about 10% difference in the total simulation run time. The well management logic has also been applied in other reservoirs in the same region with around 150 to 350 ICD/ICV wells. All cases give the same computational performance.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">The concept of reservoir connectivity is drafted in Figure 7. The injected water selectively by natural moves in the well-connected flow path ways or sweep "highways" from injectors to producers and leaves un-swept oil regions behind. Ideally, if these sweep "highways" can be identified, ICD/ICV compartments should be designed according to the displacement "highway" distributions. In reality it is difficult because it relies on the accuracy of reservoir characterization and geologic modeling. Uncertainty can be large but if the geologic model keeps updated with the newly drilling, core, and PLT data, uncertainty can be reduced.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">Compartment optimization is analogous to the simulation layer optimization (Li and Beckner, 2001). Detail FTT distribution along a wellbore and compartments are analogous to the geologic layer permeability distribution and simulation layers, respectively. Figure 10a shows a traditional layer grouping method, i.e., uniform grouping. Much finer geologic layers (blue color) need to be grouped into coarser simulation layers (red color). Since uniform grouping ignores permeability contrast, high and low permeabilities are grouped together. As a result, the heterogeneity at the fine scale level is not preserved in the coarse scale level. Figure 10b demonstrates that optimization solves this problem and now the heterogeneity at the fine scale level is preserved in the coarse scale level.</p><div id="link-10">

Beyond the threshold, adding more layers does not adding any value, Therefore, the threshold become the optimal number of simulation layers. The same algorithm can be applied for compartment optimization. As an analogy, compartment size optimization and optimal number of compartments are equivalent to optimal layer grouping and optimal number of simulation layers, respectively.
