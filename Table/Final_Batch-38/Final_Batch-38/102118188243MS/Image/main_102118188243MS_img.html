<p id="Ancr5">The stylolite layers are tight but not zero-permeable and the communications between sub-reservoirs are observed by the data obtained from logs and dynamic testing throughout the whole field. As shown in Fig. 1, this reservoir is sectorized into five areas based on geological similarity – North East, Heterogeneous, Homogeneous, Near West and West area. The North East area is fractured and faulted, having high heterogeneity and uncertainty of geology. The Near West area is relatively tight and homogeneous. The West area is tighter and undeveloped. The Homogeneous area is relatively permeable and homogeneous. The Heterogeneous area is permeable and heterogeneous with high-perm streaks (HKS) in the upper layers (Layer A to C). HKS have several hundred mD permeability compared with 5-20 mD matrix (non-HKS) permeability. Fig. 2 shows the HKS distribution in the reservoir with boundaries of Heterogeneous and Homogeneous area. We previously conducted a multi-year screening study to select the primary target areas for miscible EOR (Willingham et. al. 2016). As a result of the prior study, the Heterogeneous and Homogeneous areas were identified as the main target areas for miscible EOR based on potential recoverable oil volume and attractiveness for miscible EOR implementation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">The injector had a dual completion with the short string perforated across upper layers (Layer A and B) and the long string completed in lower layers (Layer E) with 3000 ft horizontal length as shown in Fig. 3. Before gas injection was initiated in the pilot, a water injector located 150 m away from the pilot gas injector was converted to an observer when the pilot gas injector was drilled. During the gas injection pilot, water was injected from the short string and lean HC gas was injected from the long string. This injection scheme was called as SWAG (Simultaneous Water And Gas). The purpose of this unique injection scheme was to inject water into the upper layers to prevent or minimize gas override due to gravity and improve the vertical sweep efficiency of gas injection.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">For the history match simulation, a sector model was built for the SWAG pilot area. The gas breakthrough timing at the NE producer in the simulation model matched with the observation from the actual SWAG pilot. Fig. 4 shows the gas saturation map of the history matched simulation at the timing of gas breakthrough to NE producer. Simulation results suggest that the injected gas overrides to the upper layers and hence preferentially sweeps the upper layers due to the lower density of lean gas and HKS in upper layers (i.e. the water injection from short string could not prevent the gas override).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">A simulation study for the assessment of miscible WAG injection has been conducted as a part of extensive EOR study initiated in 2000s. The sector model shown in Fig. 5 was used for the assessment of WAG injection. This model was cut from the history matched full field simulation model and is considered a representative of the maturity and geology in the Heterogeneous geologic area. Through the sensitivity and optimization studies, several WAG injection schemes were evaluated to optimize oil recovery and minimize the gas usage. The optimized WAG injection scheme, a "Tapered" WAG, modifies the duration of gas injection over time with longer gas injection cycles initially which are progressively reduced with subsequent WAG cycles as illustrated in Table 2 and Fig. 6. In addition, line drive injection with 500 m well spacing was identified as an optimal well configuration for the miscible WAG (Kohata et al. 2017).</p><div id="link-5">
