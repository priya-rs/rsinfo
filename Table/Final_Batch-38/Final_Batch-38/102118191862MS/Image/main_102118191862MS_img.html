<p id="Ancr2">The work in this laboratory has been so far spread across geology and geoscience applications and evaluations. As part of the program wells were drilled and completed in Morgantown, West Virginia (Fig. 1); these were four production wells, MIP-3H, MIP-4H, MIP-5H, MIP-6H; two pilot holes, MIP-3 and MIP-4; and a microseismic and sampled observation well, MIP-SW (Ghahfarokhi et al. 2018; Carr et al. 2017). The MIP-3H and MIP-5H wells were completed by Northeast Natural Energy, LLC (NNE) in December 2015 whereas the two previously drilled production wells MIP-4H and MIP-6H were drilled and completed in 2011.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Evaluation of well performance was conducted through the integrated workflow shown in Fig. 4, which depicts the unconventional reservoir optimized completions workflow derived from the integrated "seismic-to-simulation" workflow (Cipolla et al. 2011a). These seamlessly integrate the various processes involved in well completion design/analysis and production optimization for unconventional reservoirs. The key steps include the construction of the geological model and detailed mechanical earth model (MEM) with the geomechanical and reservoir properties, completion description, calibration of the fracture model against treatment data and microseismic observation, simulation of fracturing treatment honoring the stress shadow, generation of the numerical grid model for reservoir description, and production simulation.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Additionally, the evaluation of geomechanical property change due to the producing well conditions for future well planning needs to be evaluated. For this purpose, the workflow presented by Pankaj et al. (2016)(Fig. 5 can be used. The workflow derives the updated stresses from the depletion of the parent wellbore to model offset well/infill well fracture geometries. However, this falls outside the scope of this work, and we will limit the discussion to the workflow shown in Fig. 4 following steps 1, 2, and 3 highlighted. We have used a heat map approach instead to determine the optimum well spacing scenario.</p><div id="link-5">

Both wells are landed in the same zone with a high stress layer just below but lower stress layers above. Correspondingly, the hydraulic fractures are expected to grow upward, breaching the low-stress layers. However, there are higher-stress layers above, and fractures are expected to be contained in height at those layers.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Two techniques were adopted to calibrate the hydraulic fracture geometries. First, the treatment pressure data recorded from the field operation were used to match the pressure from the fracture simulation in the model. This gave a calibration of geomechanical model and minimum in-situ stress distribution, leakoff, and the frictional pressure drop in the flow-string. Second, the microseismic data available for both wells were used to match the fracture azimuth and footprint. At the end, both calibration pieces were honored, and a reasonable match for fracture geometries was obtained (Fig. 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Upon fracture calibration, the productive fracture volume in the model was estimated by the production history matching of the real production data. An unstructured production grid with almost 1 million grid cells was created to capture the complex fracture geometry and heterogeneity. The minimum fracture cell size in the model was set as 10 ft, and maximum cell size was 100 ft. Fig. 10 shows the pressure variation in the production grid across the topmost layer upon production simulation using a numerical simulator. The simulation was initialized in equilibration because these were the first wells drilled in the area and the wells were in static in-situ state.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show the production history matching results for the two wells. The history match was run under the rate control mode, and bottomhole pressure response was matched. The initial part 1-year period shows a good match, but the increased production rate after that saw the history match deteriorating. A sudden increase of well gas production in late 2016 appears to be why the history matching of the bottomhole pressure is hard to attain. We suggest that this abrupt gas production increase might have caused a strong drag force around the proppants in the hydraulic fractures. The high gas rate in the fractures is likely to transport some proppant and cause partial fracture closing and, as a result, a lower productivity. To reflect this in the history matching process, we lowered the productivity index of the well and attained a history match.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr14">If the treatments pumped in the wells are tailored to cover the space and acreage between the wells, then the spacing is deemed optimal. However, if the reservoir is left unstimulated and undrained, the spacing and completion program can result in leaving reserves behind because the hydraulic fracture did not simulate and produce the in-place rock effectively as shown in an example in the Fig. 13. The only means to access the rock between fractures is to drill an infill well.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr17">Reducing the well spacing further, below 990 ft, with the current pump schedule and completion designs, the wells would have hydraulic fractures overlapping to a greater degree and therefore competing for the same reservoir rock. Optimal well spacing is therefore determined at 990 ft. With varying the proppant loading for the treatment, it is observed with sensitivity analysis that the fracture half-length increases with proppant loading (Fig. 16). At the current design of approximately 1900 lbm/ft, just slightly over 450 ft half-length is achieved. Propped fracture length is close to 350 ft away from the wellbore. Therefore, the ideal well spacing is approximately 990 ft at 1900lbm/ft treatment design, which will not leave substantial volume of rock between wells undrained.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr18">The authors also compared the total fracture surface area with different well spacing scenarios (Fig. 17). As the wells get closer, the fracture surfaces from the two wells complete and overlap, whereas when the well spacing is increased, the fractures from the individual wells are farther apart, and hence lesser interference is expected. Optimal well spacing could be a point of inflection of the curve as the slope changes, shown as the intersection of the red lines for slope to the trend line.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr21">It is also noticed in the heat maps, that the fracture geometry of the MIP-5H at 990ft well spacing tends to have some additional height growth in the lower side of the wellbore. This is caused by the geomechanical property variation. To supplement the heat map, a plan view of the fractures in Fig. 20 shows that some propped fracture along the wellbore overlap marginally when the wells are spaced at 990ft spacing whereas at the current spacing of the wells, the fracture are far apart and not interfering with each other.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr22">When production simulation was run to compare the two cases of current well spacing and 990ft well spacing, it is seen that with the stress shadow allowing fracture in MIP-3H moves to the left, away from the MIP-5H, the well may have a better potential as the bottom hole pressure with the same rate control applied to both cases show improvement of 17% when the wells are closer (Fig. 21). Therefore, close spacing may improve the well productivity due to stronger stress shadow. Actual improvement quantification may however need some pilot tests at closer well spacing in the future development around the area.</p><div id="link-21">
