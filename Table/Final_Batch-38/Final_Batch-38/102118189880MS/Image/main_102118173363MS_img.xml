<anchoringText id="Ancr1">Figure 1 introduces Injection Variability Index, this is the ratio of the baseline injection rate, with zero fracture pressure variability between initiation points (clusters), to the injection rate associated with variations in perforation friction at other initiation points intra-stage. As fracture-entry pressure varies, this pressure variation is directly communicated as an equal pressure change across the perforations (Δpf), since the pressure is constant inside the wellbore across all the clusters within a stage, the injection rate will either increase or decrease at each cluster proportionally related to the perforation friction; the rate change is magnified since it is squared relative to the pressure change (Ppf ∝ Q2).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">Barree summarized the effect of a stress shadow as incremental minimum horizontal stress “sensed” by the less dominate clusters. Given the complicated nature of calculating the stress shadow for a given perforating and completion design it will not be discussed in depth, other than as a source of stress variation that justifies the use of an XLE perforating strategy. Below in Figure 4 is one example that has been published on the topic (Lecampion et al. 2015).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">This example is shown in Figure 5. Even-hole charges are engineered to greatly limit the entry hole variation and for our standard 4.5,” 11.6 lb/ft, P-110 horizontal liner at any orientation. Test data demonstrates an approximately 3% diameter variation compared to the stated entry hole diameter and thus limits the variability in perforating friction to no more than 122% and no lower than 91% relative to the stated entry hole diameter for our even-hole charge of choice. To reliably achieve the targeted pump rate when applying XLE, using charges that provide consistent entry hole at every orientation is critical.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr15">Another way to look at the data from the previous figure is with a box and whisker style plot shown in Figure 15. The box is defined by the middle two quartiles of data, with the median included as a line within the box, and the whiskers representing the maximum and minimum. In this figure, the three intra-stage bins are plotted using the percentage of fluid used in each stage to depict how even the frac fluid was distributed within each bin across all full stages logged (Stages 4-13 from Figure 14).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr16">The results of this production log analysis are shown for a single stage in Figure 16. Of note, both Figure 14 and Figure 16 are from the same Middle Bakken well, and was one of two wells in this diagnostic project. The two well average for producing cluster efficiency was 80% for the 20 complete stages logged and analyzed. The Middle Bakken stage shown below indicates 14 of 15 clusters were producing in this stage for a single stage producing PCE of 93%.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr17">The reservoir model in Figure 17 was run at several cluster efficiencies to find the best history match and the GOR forecasts along with the actual data from the flowing life of a representative well is shown. For this well we found our best history match (HM) followed the 67% cluster efficiency trend during its naturally flowing period. Of note, this well had an earlier generation completion design that did not utilize XLE or even-hole charges but did include solid particulate diverter. Ongoing reservoir modeling work is planned to evaluate later generations of completion design that incorporated XLE and HDP designs.</anchoringText>
