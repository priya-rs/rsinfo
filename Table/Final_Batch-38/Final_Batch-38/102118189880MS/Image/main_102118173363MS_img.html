<p id="Ancr1">Figure 1 introduces Injection Variability Index, this is the ratio of the baseline injection rate, with zero fracture pressure variability between initiation points (clusters), to the injection rate associated with variations in perforation friction at other initiation points intra-stage. As fracture-entry pressure varies, this pressure variation is directly communicated as an equal pressure change across the perforations (Δpf), since the pressure is constant inside the wellbore across all the clusters within a stage, the injection rate will either increase or decrease at each cluster proportionally related to the perforation friction; the rate change is magnified since it is squared relative to the pressure change (Ppf ∝ Q2).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Barree summarized the effect of a stress shadow as incremental minimum horizontal stress “sensed” by the less dominate clusters. Given the complicated nature of calculating the stress shadow for a given perforating and completion design it will not be discussed in depth, other than as a source of stress variation that justifies the use of an XLE perforating strategy. Below in Figure 4 is one example that has been published on the topic (Lecampion et al. 2015).</p><div id="link-4">

Even-hole charges are engineered to greatly limit the entry hole variation and for our standard 4.5,” 11.6 lb/ft, P-110 horizontal liner at any orientation. Test data demonstrates an approximately 3% diameter variation compared to the stated entry hole diameter and thus limits the variability in perforating friction to no more than 122% and no lower than 91% relative to the stated entry hole diameter for our even-hole charge of choice. To reliably achieve the targeted pump rate when applying XLE, using charges that provide consistent entry hole at every orientation is critical.</p><div id="link-5">
