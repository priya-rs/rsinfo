<p id="Ancr3">In this paper we analyze one of three sequential SWCTTs, by means of reservoir simulation and assisted history matching. The SWCTTs were performed on a selected well in a mature on-shore field in West Africa (Figure 1). The EOR efficiency with low salinity water and surfactant injection was evaluated and compared to sea water flood. These tests and interpretation of the tests using an analytical approach was presented by Callegaro et al. (2014). Here we focus on the second one of these tests in our assisted history matching.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Water-oil relative permeability curves were set to typical curves measured in the field (Figure 2). For these simulations, relative permeability is not critical, as the tracer simulation starts after the well has been injecting large amounts of water. The near-well reservoir zone can therefore be assumed to be at residual oil saturation (i.e. no mobile oil exist). Oil saturations were therefore set to a constant value, which is one of the parameters in the matching process. The tracer transport thus occur in a setting with fixed oil and water saturations.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">To optimize the simulations the number of gridblocks should be minimized without reducing the numerical accuracy. Numerical smearing can be a significant problem for SWCTT simulations (Huseby et al. 2012).In such cases it is important to use a grid that reduces smearing enough that it does not compromise the investigation of physical dispersion or mixing in the problem. As shown in Figure 3, a cylindrical grid with two blocks in the vertical direction, representing the two main layers (in addition to an inactive layer separating these two) was used.</p><div id="link-3">

The simulation option used here also introduce smearing depending on the time step, where smaller time steps give less smearing. Different values of the time steps were also tested. Using relevant values for dispersion, results for N= 200, N= 300 and N= 500 and for time steps of 0.01 days and 0.001 days, small effects of the grid and time discretization is visible (cf. Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Using this approach we do not distinguish between the data points close to the peak and those in the tail. Results from this approach are displayed in Figure 5 and the final parameter estimations are summarized in Table 1. Overall, the match between simulated and measured tracer response seems fair for NPA and very good for EtAc and EtOH. For IPA, the cover tracer injected during injection of the other tracers as well as during the push-volume injection, we expect a sigmoidal solution.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Similarity of EtAc and NPA curves is expected for cases where the oil is stagnant and no drift is present in the reservoir, and similarity of the curves ensures that the saturation estimates are not corrupted by drift. The reason for the shape similarity is explained in Figure 7. Since the NPA curve is similar to the EtAc curve, it can be used as an alternative to estimate saturation and is sometime used as a backup for the EtAc tracer in case all the ester hydrolyses (if the hydrolysis rate is too large).</p><div id="link-7">

<figcaption><b>Figure 7 </b> During a SWCTT the cover tracer NPA, which is a non-partitioning water tracer, follows water in and out. EtAc is a partitioning oil/water tracer, with a partitioning to oil given by the partitioning coefficient K. During injection, EtAc is delayed compared to NPA. During production, EtAc has a shorter distance to travel, and as a result, the shape of the EtAc and NPA production curves should be similar, unless reservoir drift affect the tracer transport during shut-in.</figcaption>
