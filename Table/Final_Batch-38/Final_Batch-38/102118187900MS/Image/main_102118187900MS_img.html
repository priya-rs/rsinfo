<p id="Ancr2">The Filanovsky oil and gas condensate field was discovered in 2005 in the Rakushechnoye uplift in the Russian part of the Caspian Sea. This field is one of the biggest offshore fields in Russia (Fig.2). Recoverable reserves include 129 million tons of oil, and 30 billion tons of gasм3. The complex structure of the Rakushechnoye uplift is linked to Middle Jurassic mostly clastic and carbonate beds.</p><div id="102118187900MS-Img_SPi-2">

According to the well correlation scheme (Fig.3), properties of Neocomian rocks show considerable variation in different wells. Lithological replacement and onlapping of K1nc3 unit observed in reference well 1. Oil water contact was detected at depth -1442.2 m TVDSS.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Multiple drilling simulations using various geosteering technologies have confirmed that only the deep directional resistivity technology can solve all of the tasks posed due to its large survey radius. Drilling simulation allowed to analyze the nature of the technology response in geological conditions of the field, and also to consider various drilling scenarios: the basic drilling model (Fig. 4), drastic change of the structural angle, changing the depth of the Neocomian tops (15 m vertical above / below), the intersection of faults.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Top of the target formation occurred 10 m deeper than in the initial model; bedding angle showed up to 1.5 degree difference from simulated. Application of DDR technology allowed us to perform proactive tracking of depth of occurrence variation, as well as to estimate the structural angle of occurrence of the target beds. Updated inversion value allowed to correct drilling path for successful stabilization interval location for sidetracking, bottom was located at the planned coordinates above the target bed top (Fig. 6). Inversion data showed that actual bottom is located 3m above the Neocomian top.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">The velocity-depth model was updated (the second stage) upon the completion of drilling. Isochrone maps, structural maps, and related stratigraphic picks were used to correct the velocity-depth model. Velocity model was calibrated according to well data, which resulted in the amendments to depth image cube. Fragments of depth and relative acoustic impedance cubes along the well path (Well 4) with DDR inversion are illustrated in Figure 7, which shows good convergence of superdeep EM processing results and seismic data.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">Drilling of Well 5 (the first stage) was based on the updated static model developed using the data obtained during drilling of Well 4. The pre-drill modelling for Well 5 showed that DDR inversion allows to map the pay zones at distance up to 19 m (vertical depth) during landing and 12 m during drilling inside of target intervals (Fig.9). While drilling horizontal section it was planned to penetrate first four Neocomian sand units and flatten half of path in K1nc4.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">During drilling of the landing and horizontal sections the well DDR inversion allowed to track pay boundaries within 24 m (vertical depth). The survey depth allowed inversion to evaluate remote determination of the Neocomian top displacement 4m shallower and to calculate the structural angle of occurrence. Acquired data allowed to drill stabilization interval, and interval bottom was set 3m above the top of the target bed. Bottom was located at 2188 mMD, planned bottom was at 2200 mMD (Fig. 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">While drilling the horizontal interval, inversion provided mapping of the first pay unit after exiting the casing. After 2430 m DDR inversion provided tracking of boundaries of all Neocomian pay units within 24 m (vertical depth). At the same time the Neocomian top and base were also mapped (Fig.11). DDR inversion showed an increase of thickness of a shale neck between the second and the fourth units. This pointed to the onlapping of the third unit in the drilling area (Fig.9 and 11).</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">For well 5 correction of the velocity-depth model (the second stage) and updating of the structural surfaces was performed continuously, as data on resistivity and density image was being received, hence allowing to make necessary corrections to the structural surfaces in real time. After penetration of the Neocomian top, structural surfaces were corrected in order to reduce structural uncertainties while drilling horizontal interval. Real-time updating of seismic data allowed to predict the change of structural angle in fold area (Fig.2) and started to plan correction of trajectory. DDR inversion confirmed the dip changes in further drilling. Fig. 12 provides an example for the Filanovsky field Well 5, which shows the comparison of seismic data and inversion of direct EM measurements.</p><div id="link-12">
