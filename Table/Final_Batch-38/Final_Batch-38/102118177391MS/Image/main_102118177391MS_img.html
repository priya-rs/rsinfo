<p id="Ancr1">The Azeri-Chirag-Gunashli (ACG) is the oil field located in the Azerbaijan sector of the South Caspian Sea. Production started in 1980 from the shallow water Gunashli (SWG) section of the field, which is currently being operated by the State Oil Company of the Azerbaijan Republic (SOCAR). The other parts of the field came on stream in 1997 – Chirag, 2005 – Azeri, 2008 – deep water Gunashli (DWG) and 2014 – West Chirag, and are operated by BP on the behalf of Azerbaijan International Operating Company (AIOC) (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">One of the important features of the new template is the visualization of injector and producer WAFs through time (Figure 2a) capturing the impact on future wells and losses to the aquifer as well. Such visualization offers the first step health check of the injector before calculating its efficiency. For example, injection water loss to the aquifer would lower down the injection efficiency.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Since StreamCalc algorithm provides amount of flow through regions (reservoir layers and sectors), it is possible to construct allocation factor plots on a regional basis as well. Figure 4 shows regional allocation factor plot for an injector. It describes the amount of the support or how much of the injected water goes to specific region. Azeri injector (AzE-W03) provides support to Fasila B reservoir of the East and Central Azeri North Flank throughout its life. Similarly, this plot would indicate contribution of the reservoirs and sectors to the production of a producer.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Advantage of StreamCalc™ module in analyzing non-convective flow made it possible to construct such plots for gas injectors as well. Alternatively, injector efficiencies can be visualized instantaneously (Figure 7). Recovered oil volumes are plotted versus injected volumes. Efficiency lines (25 %, 50 %, 75 % and 100 %) are placed on the plot for visual interpretation of results and well ranking. If the well is located on 100 % efficiency line, it would drain the oil rate equal to the 100 % of the injected volume. Similarly, injectors located on 75 % line would drain the oil rate equal to the 75 % of the total injection rate from offset producers.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Another visualization – Ranking Plot (Figure 8) is generated to separate the wells with same efficiencies but different oil recoveries and injection rates. Ranking is calculated based on Eq. 4. Figure 8 shows how the picture changes based on ranking criteria (Eq. 3 or 4). Even though gas injector AzC-G05 has lower efficiency compared to other wells, it becomes more important when Eq. 4 is applied to rank the wells as it recovers more oil from offset producers compared to other injectors.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">One of applications of the tool was based on its ability to visualize injector-producer interaction through time. West Azeri producer – AzW-P04 was going to be shut in for gas lift retrofit intervention job. Conventional surveillance techniques suggested that the well is under the direct influence of AzW-W01 injector (30 mbd injection rate) which was in accordance with streamline simulation results (Figure 9). In order to prevent AzW-P04 area from watering out during the intervention job, decision has to be made to decrease AzW-W01 injection rate by certain amount.</p><div id="link-9">
