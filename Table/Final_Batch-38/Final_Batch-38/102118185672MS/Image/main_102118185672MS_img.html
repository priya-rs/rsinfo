<p id="Ancr2">This paper discusses the integrated workflow implemented on a single horizontal well to evaluate multiple completion and stimulation designs to understand its impact on hydraulic fracture geometry and production performance. The standardized workflow shown in Fig.1 can be applied to any unconventional play and has been proven effective in determining the completion and stimulation design for maximized production. Economic analysis should be incorporated for the optimal completion design.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The Avalon shale is primarily a self-sourced rock consisting of siltstone, limestone, clay, chert, and organics. It is subdivided into three zones—upper, middle and lower shales — isolated by carbonate debris flows (Fig. 4). Each zone has variable rock properties inherited from variations in depositional environments across the Delaware basin. Siliciclastic mudstones in the upper and lower Avalon are considered to be of good reservoir quality and are highly productive, whereas the carbonate-rich middle Avalon is considered not productive because of the high percentage of carbonates, which is associated with bad reservoir quality.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">A 3D numerical reservoir simulator that uses an autogridding algorithm is applied to generate an unstructured grid for the simulated complex fracture network for production history match and forecast. History matching the well production after a period of stable production is necessary to understand the performance of the hydraulic fracturing treatment. After the complex hydraulic fractures are modeled and calibrated, a reservoir simulation unstructured grid that honors the hydraulic fracture geometry and proppant distribution was built. The grid consisted of 34 layers with ~820,000 cells; a finer cell size of 10' was assigned for the complex fracture and a larger cell size of 300' for the matrix (Fig. 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">Over the years, stimulation design in unconventional reservoirs has evolved from conservative to radical designs. Proppant job size and fluid volumes are among the top critical design parameters in hydraulic fracturing design. Proppant job size has a large impact on the hydraulic fracture geometry created. Fig. 10 shows the total surface area and propped surface area generated by the UFM for the proppant job size sensitivity. Increased surface area and propped surface area with increasing proppant job size is observed. This is driven primarily by both height containment and fracture length growth.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">Finding a balance for the optimum cluster spacing is highly critical. In this category, to evaluate different cluster spacing configurations on the hydraulic fracture geometry, the proppant job size was kept the same. Fig.11 shows that as cluster spacing decreased, total surface area and propped surface area increased, likely due to increase in fracture complexity resulting in more stimulated area around the wellbore. The 30-ft scenario gave the largest surface area but also gave an overall smaller fracture length and shorter fracture height for each stage. The 30-ft scenario also had the highest number of stages.</p><div id="link-11">

Fig. 12 shows minimal difference in the surface area that was created by varying the maximum proppant concentration, because the proppant job size and fluid volume were the same for all the scenarios. The average fracture conductivity is also displayed, which shows an increasing trend.</p><div id="link-12">
