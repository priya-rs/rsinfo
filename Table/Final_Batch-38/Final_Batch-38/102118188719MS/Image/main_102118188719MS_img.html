<p id="Ancr8">The Free Water Level (FWL) was analyzed based on the OWC from logs and adding capillary pressure displacement pressure (PD) to it. In this approach the minimum and maximum FWL can be found based on the PDmin and PDmax values for each rock type. The two main rock types in the studied reservoir are Rock Type#5 and 6 and hence, PD (in terms of height) associated with these rock types are only used in the FWL analysis. This approach gives the deepest FWL at x876 ft. (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">One well located in South-West corner of the field has MDT data which gives the FWL at X782 ft TVDSS. However, to be consistent with the notional contacts it was necessary to shift the pressure points by adding approximately 250 psi to the values. This effectively meant that the pressure readings represented a situation where that area of the field was approximately 250 psi under-pressured from depletion. After the shift to account for depletion, it was found that the pressure points are lined up well with the notional contacts and gradients (Figure 9)</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">A 3D porosity model was generated by using a Krigging algorithm without any trend for the hydrocarbon pool area to honour the large amount of well (422 wells) data variation without any imposed trends. Another 3D Krigging model incorporating the seismic trend was generated to represent the geological variation in the flanks. These two 3D porosity models (cubes) were then merged to be used as combined porosity model. For the purpose of investigating alternative models to the combined model workflow, two additional porosity models were generated by SGS simulation (Figure 11).</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">The identification of changing fluid contacts across the field required an equilibrium treatment in the simulator to honour these conditions. The selected method used multiple equilibrium regions to capture the fluid contact changes across the reservoir. The first step was to generate an FWL map that honoured the data at each oil rim well and many locations in the gas cap. In particular, the FWL assigned honoured to the possible extent, saturation height function derived Sw to the observed log Sw. Figure 13 below shows the resulting continuous map of FWL across the reservoir.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr16">Throughout the course of the study the understanding of the reservoir physics improved. The 4 primary areas of substantial investigation of the reservoir physics during the history matching included accounting for 1) a tilted FWL, 2) a tilted GOC, 3) more robust saturation modelling and 4) permeability degradation across the FWL boundary and into the aquifer. Figure 16 shows a tornado chart parameter comparison for the history match production for the gas cap and for the oil rim. The charts show that the gas cap gas production history was relatively insensitive to the variations in the history match parameters. However, the oil rim oil production was much more sensitive to the variations in the history match parameters.</p><div id="link-16">

To formulate the most optimum redevelopment option, phased development was chosen (Figure 17), where the areas are divided into Phase I and Phase II (full field oil rim) areas, where a positive outcome from Phase I shall be incorporated into execution of Phase II (Figure 18). Also, target pressure was defined, where only a limited amount of water shall be injected to target either maintenance of the current reservoir pressure or build-up of reservoir pressure to some reasonable higher target pressure.

<p id="Ancr19">The option of “Maintain Pressure” with water injection (option-2) showing around 21% incremental recovery over the field life was selected as the best case redevelopment scenario. In this case, the reservoir pressure is targeted to be maintained at a slightly increased level. The existing oil producers were converted to down dip water injectors. Mid-dip producers and Up-dip injectors are the new proposed wells (Figure 19). An assumption is made that the maximum water injection rate for Up-dip wells is 10 MSTB/D/well and for Down-dip wells is 5 MSTB/D/well. An average of 250 MSTB/D is the required water rate that needs to be injected to maintain the reservoir pressure at the elevated level. The production of 20 MSTB/D in Phase I and Phase II areas can be maintained for 8 years with a total production of 204.0 MMstb at the end of production year 2060.</p><div id="link-19">

<p id="Ancr21">The key difference between option-2 and option-3 within the Phase I and Phase II redevelopment area is drive mechanism, as option-2 has Down-dip water injectors whereas in option-2 nitrogen gas injectors are placed in Down-dip. In Figure 21, option-2 clearly indicates a longer production plateau for an additional 4 years with an additional cumulative production of 33.5 MMstb. However, water production is more than in option-3 due to more water being injected in both Up-dip and Down-dip wells.</p><div id="link-21">
