The highlands of the Marathon Fold and Thrust Belt and foredeep were situated to the south. Fig. 1 shows various producing zones primarily in the Wolfcamp and Spraberry formations.

<p id="Ancr6">Pioneer has collected microseismic data on over a portion of more than 250 horizontal wells, which is one of the largest collections of microseismic data in the industry. When calibrated with other datasets and filtered in a consistent manner, microseismic data has shown to be a reliable indicator of fracture geometry in the Permian Basin shales. A reliable data collection, QC, filtering, and storage process is critical to getting maximum benefit from a large microseismic dataset. We have developed and documented a detailed workflow as summarized by Fig. 4, which ensures our microseismic dataset is evaluated in a consistent and reliable manner.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">In addition to a high quality dataset, a multi-disciplinary approach to completion design is key to optimizing completion in a timely and cost-effective manner (Jaripatke et al., 2013 &amp; 2014). Fig. 5 shows the multi-disciplinary process that has evolved over the last four years and led to successful multi-stack development. We have divided the process into three broad categories:</p><div id="link-5">

Fig. 6 shows one example combination of database and visualization tools. With all microseismic stored in a database, single-well microseismic data can be quickly visualized. In addition, statistics from multiple wells can be quickly retrieved from the database and visualized in a summary view. Finally, microseismic data can be visualized alongside the geologic model to better understand how reservoir layering and fracture design influence fracture geometry.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Once the model is established, reservoir simulations are performed for production history match and forecast. The newly calibrated fracture model is then used for sensitivity analysis for various possible designs and their impact. Comparisons between decline-curve based EURs and increasing fracture model surface area is shown in Fig. 8. It is important to note that while an increasing trend is observed with increased fracture model surface area, the correlation is also heavily influenced by well spacing and child effects (A "child" well is defined as a well completed after nearby "parent" well(s) produced for a certain amount of time).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">As increasing surface area generally requires increased capital spending, well spacing comes into play as shown in Fig. 9. The question is whether we drill fewer wells with larger completions and achieve the same or better results per section than we obtain with more wells and smaller completion designs. The figure demonstrates that for super large jobs, EUR does not degrade if wells are widely spaced (i.e. no interaction between wells). On the other hand, for smaller jobs at the same spacing, we achieve lower EURs and leave untapped hydrocarbons between the wells. As well spacing gets tighter, EURs for larger treatments decrease due to interference.</p><div id="link-9">

In the example shown in the figure, three cases are presented. Cases A &amp; C have two wells on each pad, and have same well spacing while case B has three wells with the outside wells spaced the same as the two on pad A &amp; C (that is, Case B has half the well separation than cases A &amp; C).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">A typical recent Permian well has a landing depth between 7,000 and 10,500 feet TVD with lateral length in the range of 7,000 and 13,000 feet. The wells are typically drilled and cased with three or four casing strings including 5½" production casing. The reservoir pressures typically vary between 3,500 and 6,000 psi with reservoir temperatures between 140 and 180 degrees Fahrenheit. Typical completion designs are implemented using pump down "Plug and Perf" method with 6,000 – 9,000 psi surface treating pressure. While designing the completion plan, well-interaction considerations must be taken into account, as shown in Fig. 11.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr14">The following factors are considered in order to optimize fracture containment: 1) fluid volume (bbl/cluster), 2) fluid injection rate (bpm/cluster), 3) cluster spacing and stage length and 4) cluster stimulation efficiency (e.g. diversion techniques). Fig. 12 shows the evolution of cluster spacing and stage length during development of our Permian assets to date. Each successive reduction in cluster spacing showed improvement in well performance while containing the hydraulic fracture closer to the wellbore. However, decreasing stage length also comes with increased cost.</p><div id="link-12">
