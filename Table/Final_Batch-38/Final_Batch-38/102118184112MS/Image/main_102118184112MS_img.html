<p id="Ancr4">Kuwait heavy oil deposits are in the shallow-depth unconsolidated sand shale reservoirs. There are two main sands, Sand 1 (upper) and Sand 2 (lower), bound on the top by a sealing cap shale (Fig. 1). The cap shale trapped the light oil, which migrated from deep down because of tectonic activities. The trapped light oil biodegraded because the low formation temperature (~90°F) is conducive to bacteria survival and can consume the lighter oil fractions, thus leaving the heavy residue.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">This equipment was designed to perform traditional PVT-type manipulations of temperature and pressure, while simultaneously recording the optical signal in the NIR and visible range. By varying the temperature and pressure, the resulting optical data set includes natural variation that can be encountered during a real-world well situation. Each measurement set results in thousands of optical spectra for a single fluid that are sorted and averaged according to temperature and pressure. Fig. 3 shows the optical signatures of the three heavy stock tank oils.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">Fig. 5 shows an example from Well B in Field A. Fig. 5a shows the real-time results from the MOC sensor during the downhole analysis. The sensor indicates that the fluid at the beginning of the pumpout operation was primarily water. The fluid transitioned from water to oil after some time, which is indicated by the presence of saturates (dark green) and aromatics (light green).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Another important sampling aspect is to identify the location from which to sample. Composition gradients and reservoir compartmentalization are strong influences for sampling location. Unfortunately, it is difficult to detect gradients in real time and challenging to identify reservoir boundaries accurately. The MOC sensor can eliminate many of these uncertainties by accurately measuring the fluid composition in situ. Well A in Field A was measured at 576, 643, and 819 ft. Fig. 6 shows the MOC sensor results, which reveal the depths are characterized by a single reservoir. The fluid composition shows only small, inconsistent variations with each depth.</p><div id="link-6">
