<p id="Ancr2">The Wilcox trend in GOM ultra Deepwater is an emerging oil production frontier ranging from northeast Mexico Burgos Basin to the southern American states of Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. As demonstrated in Figure 1, the trend occurs in the western and central GOM covering three primary protraction areas: Alaminos Canyon, Keathley Canyon, and Walker Ridge. The frontier hydrocarbon potential was discovered by well, Trident-1, which was drilled in the western GOM on the Alaminos Canyon protraction area. Chevron has major discoveries in the Wilcox trend.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">A multidisciplinary project team was formed that includes reservoir modelling and simulation, facility, drilling and completion, commercial, technology, and economic analysts, etc. to effectively screen and select an optimal recovery method. Figure 2 depicts the selected systematic workflow showing the key cross-functional teams used to provide reliable assessment of Wilcox gas injection performance to support field development plan decision-making.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Step 2: Run each simulation case from step 1 and analyze the simulation results using pore volume injected (PVI) vs incremental oil recovery factor (RF) dimensionless plot to select a few cases with superior performance (recovery factor/PVI). In addition to the PVI plot check the oil rate profiles and other diagnostic plots to identify the case with early secondary recovery incremental oil barrels. Figure 3 shows the PVI plot for the GFW injection process.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">In our miscible gas study, gas was injected into the Wilcox reservoirs above their MMP in some cases above their FCP for those reservoirs where it could be measured. By injecting above the MMP, the injected gas mixes with the insitu undersaturated oil to form a single phase, reduces oil viscosity and improves microscopic sweep efficiency. To achieve optimal recovery, gas injection should be implemented at reservoir pressure above the MMP and if possible above the FCP. Figure 4 depicts viscosity reduction due to gas injection.</p><div id="link-4">
