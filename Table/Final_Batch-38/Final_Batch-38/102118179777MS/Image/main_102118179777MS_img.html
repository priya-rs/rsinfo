<p id="Ancr2">The test was carried out for six months to quantify the inflow profiles and injectivity to the reservoir under matrix conditions. For the steam trial in another area of the field, three producers and one injector with FO were utilized over a period of 25 months to demonstrate the feasibility of a horizontal well steam development and to evaluate the requirement and effectiveness of injection conformance. Figure 1 shows the polymer and steam trial areas.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Many SPE papers, books and websites 3–9 discuss the physics and application of DTS/DAS. The tool setup and working principles to create DTS/DAS profiles are briefly summarized in Figure 2. The instrument set-up for fiber optics consists of an instrument box which contains the laser source and analyzer. The laser source launches a multiple laser light pulse that lasts for [1]10ns. The laser pulses are directed to the fiber line by means of a directional coupler and the light pulse propagates along the fiber and energizes the glass, lattice structure and molecules/atoms.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The main back-scattered light is at a wavelength of the launched wave and is called the Rayleigh peak which is the strongest back-scattered signal associated to noise and this is used for acoustic data (DAS). The next closest peak is the Brillouin peak and the waves are associated with the lattice vibration but it is very difficult to separate these from main Rayleigh peak. The Raman peak is the weakest peak in the back-scattered light and it is associated to molecular or atomic vibration. It also has a unique temperature dependence which makes it a useful signal for temperature evaluation (DTS). The back- scattered spectrum is shown in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

A thermal baseline was first obtained from the pre-injection period (before water and polymers were injected). This step was carried out to identify if there were any events or formation anomalies in temperature that should be taken into consideration before any injection took place.</p><div id="link-9">

Close to the depth where the majority of the fluid is injected, the log shows a sudden change in lithology which is likely to happen only if a fault is crossed. The presence of a fault is supported by the Ant-Track map shown in Figure 13.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr17">In this fashion they would benefit not only from the elevated temperatures (and subsequent reduced viscosities) and associated increased oil production but also serve as observations wells after shut-in. Unfortunately the DTS installation in Well A failed resulting in no temperature data being collected from this well. Well B had the DTS cable successfully installed and continued to gather downhole temperature data post shut-in. The relative well positions in the reservoir and distances are depicted below in Figure 16.</p><div id="link-16">

The temperature continues to increase and expand along the entire horizontal section. This increase in temperature is captured in the plot below (Figure 17), with the final temperature being in June, 2013 just before the well was shut-in. At this stage the DTS cable is measuring steam temperatures along three quarters of the well bore.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr19">After Well B has been shut-in, it becomes an observation well measuring temperatures at the top of the formation. If a steam chest is formed it would be represented as steam temperatures (+260°) in Well B which is under static conditions. However, if steam does not rise, or if the steam chest collapses this would be observed by temperatures in Well B not reaching steam temperatures or falling below steam temperatures. Figure 18 represents the temperature response in Well B during its shut-in period (May 2013 onwards). Two key features occur after Well B is shut-in.</p><div id="link-18">

Indeed only the first 100 to 150m of the well remains at steam temperatures, Figure 19. This is the clearest indication, that whilst there is steam injection along the length of the wellbore, the distribution of the injection is uneven with higher amount of steam being diverted to a few higher permeability zones.</p><div id="link-19">

In the first week the entire wellbore cooled to 160°C with the exception of a 50m section that remains at steam temperature. However, in less than a month the temperature in the entire wellbore has collapsed to 160°C. This further highlights the effect of sweep on incremental oil due and the requirement to use flow control in the future, see Figure 20.</p><div id="link-20">
