<p id="Ancr3">The "A" West heavy oil field is located on the Eastern Flank of the South Oman Salt Basin. The field was discovered in the seventies and was brought on stream in the eighties. The heavy oil is contained in two separate dome shaped unconformity traps (Fig. 1) that were formed by the deep erosive incision into a more than 800m thick sequence of high net-to-gross sandy braided river, aeolian and alluvial fan sandstones belonging to the Cambrian Haradh, Amin and Mahwis formations. This erosive palaeo-relief was subsequently sealed by an on-lapping infill of mudrock dominated deposits belonging to the Carboniferous - Permian Al Khlata and Gharif formations and Nahr Umr mudstones at the base of the overburden. Most of the "A" West STOIIP is contained in the braided river sandstones of the Haradh Formation. Porosity and permeability ranges from 23 - 27 % and 10 – 5,000 mD, respectively.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The most recent formation pressure data (Figure 2), collected in 2015 from the aquifer while drilling the 3.3 acre infill wells, appears to confirm the ability of the APO wells to lower the aquifer pressure below the development area quicker than expected. This new information triggered the need for the APO target revision. This revision was also deemed critical by the "N" field team, who were considering using the excess APO water from "A" field to support the "N" field water flooding project.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The "A" West, "N" and "K" West fields are adjacent fields roughly 10 km apart. The "A" West field produces from the Haradh, Amin and Mahwis formations see Figure 3. The "N" and "K" West fields mainly produce from the Mahwis formation. The RFT pressures collected in the aquifer below these fields all suggest a common aquifer pressure. The "N" field is developed as a bottom water flood, initially only with aquifer water. Since 2015 water is injected into the aquifer to maintain the reservoir pressure and improve the recovery factor. Also in "K" West water is injected to boost the recovery factor.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">An aquifer pressure below the thermal development area of ~6000 kPa (at 1105 m tvdss) is targeted, to meet the optimum steam flooding operating pressure in "A" West reservoir [ref.2]. In order to quickly meet a similar pressure target (Figure 4) and hence to achieve a more hydrostatic pressure gradient between reservoir and aquifer, 46000 m3/d aquifer offtake was recommended in the Field Development Plan (FDP). To deliver 46000 m3/d APO rate, 19 APO wells had been approved in the 2016 Business Plan. The 46000 m3/d APO capacity is only required until the targeted aquifer pressure is achieved, after which the APO rate will be reduced gradually to avoid oil cusping into the aquifer.</p><div id="link-4">

Four additional APO wells have been drilled in 2015, out of which two were commissioned in 2016 together with AL107. AL107 was restored early 2016.

A simple one water tank model was sufficient to populate the APO profile that honors the reservoir operating strategy. The water tank model is attached to an analytical aquifer model to capture the aquifer support effect. All the water produced from the reservoir, after discounting the cold water equivalent to the steam injected, is assumed to be aquifer water (Figure 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr13">The total water production profile from the latest business plan forecast was used in the first forecast iteration (yellow curve in Figure 11). The program then calculates the reservoir pressure drop. When the aquifer pressure reaches the 6000 kPa target, the total water rate (reservoir and aquifer combined) is then gradually reduced to maintain a constant aquifer pressure (red curve in Figure 11). The aquifer pump off rate (green curve in Figure 11) is then calculated for each step change.</p><div id="link-11">

As captured in Figure 13 (magenta continuous line), the predicted pressure profile in April 2016 is consistent with the pressure profiles from MDT/XPT data collected in 2015 and 2016. The HM-FFM model suggests (Figure 13, green dashed line) that the aquifer pressure will reach 6000 kPa in 2019. This is aligned with the MBAL results.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr16">By looking at the results from a regional angle (Figure 14 and Figure 15), it has been observed that the planned pump-off rate in the Business Plan will reduce the "A" West Aquifer pressure to 6,000 kPa by 2023. Moreover, the model suggests that no more than 30% of the planned pump-off rate (~22,000 m3/d) after 2023 is needed to maintain the aquifer pressure at 6,000 kPa. It is worth underlining that these results are conservative, as the pressure looked at in this study is the average pressure of the whole "A" West aquifer rather than the pressure below the development area.

In this scenario the "N" reservoir pressure increased by 2 bar in 2020 and 11 bar in 2040 compared to the base case forecast (red). From this figure it can be concluded that there is a limited impact from "A" APO on the "N" aquifer pressure.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr25">The resulting APO production profiles from three different studies are illustrated in Figure 23 below. The dot on each plot represents the year the Aquifer pressure reaches 6000 kPa. The primary constraint for the regional aquifer model is the production rate (from latest Business Plan). All the other models are pressure constrained (secondary constraint for MBAL) and hence observe a decline in APO production whenever the aquifer pressure reaches 6000 kPa. Based on the results from the multiple studies, three cases have been populated for the key assumptions of the predicted production profile (Table 2).</p><div id="link-23">
