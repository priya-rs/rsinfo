<p id="Ancr1">The objective of this project was to define the optimum exploitation strategy and maximize the recovery factor through different simulation studies with Integrated Asset Modeling approach to evaluate a mature field under reactivation (FDP), water injection as secondary recovery due high pressure decline, for the current operating wells, the definition of the artificial lift strategy was needed to maintain production. Different strategies were evaluated (Figure 1) considering actions to mitigate all these challenges mentioned above taking into account the effects related with: open new wells to production, water injection, artificial lift systems, etc.</p><div id="link-1">

With this we could identify the key projects with more attractive indicators over the average for both indicators. Then well conversion from production to injection would offer the best PIR, mainly the staggered injection offers the best NPV, so the best scenario is the well conversion with staggered injection.</p><div id="link-15">

We can identify the risk (in this case there is no risk for having a no profitable project with this considerations) and make a deeper comparison for the scenarios. We can identify the gas lift – ESP as the higher value, but also the one with the higher risk (higher standard deviation), helping us to make the best decision not only with single values, but with a wide range analysis figure 17 Appendix A.</p><div id="link-17">

Available simulation model was used to perform the sensitivity for this test. The history match for WCUT in the simulation model for this well has a very good quality, the proximity of this well to the WOC and the properties quality to their level of connectivity made it strong candidate. As main result of this exercise, was observed that the sand A2 won pressure and this effect generated a positive impact on wells that are engaged in prediction lack of power with natural flow, figure 21 Appendix A.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr23">Finding the best plateau was possible generating several combinations and comparing vs cumulative production (figure 23), giving attention to some wells producing at higher rate, reducing production can favor not only to obtain the plateau but also control wells with high WCUT and GOR, helping to artificial lift systems to have better performance and compensate this reduction with other wells with more potential or no restriction for water for example.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr24">Using the simulation model, different rates were assigned to the wells as described before to balance the production per reservoir, the figure 24 Appendix A, shows two strategies after several tests to reduce the production in A2 to mitigate the high pressure declination. The proportion in production per reservoir that can change at a given plateau for the field. In strategy B the proportion for A1 is 58% vs 25% of A2, it means that after this analysis was defined the rate per well can be assigned and avoid several problems satisfying the production plateau.</p><div id="link-24">
