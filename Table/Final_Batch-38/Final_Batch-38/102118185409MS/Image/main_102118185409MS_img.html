<p id="Ancr9">The pilot scheme was prepared with the use of existing producing wells in which inter well spacing is 200 to 250m. The pilot has been selected in view of the average petrophysical characteristics of the Viraj- IX + X horizon in the northern part of the field (Figure-1). The area is away from fault and encroaching water. The pattern of pilot selected is "four inverted 5-spot pattern with 4 injectors and 9 producers". The four injectors are (#18, 21, 24 and 30) and 9 producers (#9, 11, 14, 17, 25, 27, 31, 1 &amp; one new well IVA-1). The distance between two producers is 200-250m. The total area is about 22000 m2. The average thickness is 19m, porosity 31% and saturation is 84%.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">The performance of 9 pilot wells and 7 offset wells is given in (Figure-2). Testing results indicate gain in the liquid production in all the pilot producers. The gain in oil rates and reduction in water cut has been observed in all the pilot wells. This has led to increased oil production from 50 m3/d in May'2002 to a level of 200 m3/d in June'2003 whereas water cut has decreased from 83% to 66%. The substantial oil gain and reduction in water cut was observed in two wells (#14 and #27).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr11">The performance plot of star performer well #14 is shown in Figure-3. It is clear from the figure that the oil rate has increased from 2m3/d to 50m3/d and water cut decreases to the level of 25% from 90%. Emulsion formation was found in two wells (#14 and #23) which show that ASP flood process is working and effective in mobilizing the crude oil. It was estimated that 58000 m3 of additional oil was produced and decrease in water cut of about 17% by ASP process.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr13">The simulation study has been carried out in April' 2010. It showed that front was moved uniformly in all direction. During the pilot implementation imbalance in injection and liquid production was observed due to completion problems of five producer in both the layers as shown in Figure-5. Simulation study confirmed the decreases in oil saturation in pilot area by moving the mobile oil towards down-dip side of structure as depicted in Figure-5 and Figure-6.</p><div id="link-5">
