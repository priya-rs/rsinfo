<p id="Ancr3">A third history matching approach called ensemble based methods (Evensen, 2003) has gained relevance during recent years. In this algorithm, proxy model techniques can be combined with full field simulations. This creates a balance between having enough physics based full field simulations, with, extensive and rapid sampling of the uncertainty space by using proxy surfaces, thereby preserving accuracy in the results (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The chance of certain events occurring, based on additional data such as field production history, are represented by the “likelihood”. The updates in our beliefs regarding the uncertainties, having incorporated the real data and its likelihood, are represented by the “posterior distribution”. In the MCMC method, posterior distributions obtained after assisted history matching are used for the prediction phase, thus, ensuring that a more robust view of the uncertainty ranges are used in generating the prediction and reserve forecasts (Fig. 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The second group contains the rest of the cases where a simple “kernel regression” is used for the proxy model. A combined proxy model is then created, with higher resolution in areas with a high likelihood of finding solutions and lower quality for the rest of the search space. This is shown in Fig 5, where the lower error dataset fitted using “kriging” have an almost perfect correlation between the simulated and proxy predicted values. While, the higher error training points are more loosely correlated due to a weaker proxy in that region.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Parameter distri-butions were updated based on this analysis, where the model response indicated certain values to be more or less likely. Assisted History Matching was then performed by applying a Markov Chain Monte-Carlo and proxy based workflow. A large set of matched cases were rapidly generated from the use of proxy modelling and conditioned forecasts based on posterior distributions were obtained. The evolution of the history matches through this workflow is shown in Fig. 6. The final result was a stochastically generated P10-P50-P90 range of in-place and recoverable volumes.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">In our experi-ence, it is better to purposely start with a wider range of static and dynamic uncertainties that could later be constrained based on insights gained from parameter correlation analysis in scoping cycles. Learnings from front-end manual history matching were also useful in framing uncertainties. Major reservoir uncertainties modelled were the field and channel facies extent, porosity and regional pore volume variations, water saturation, contacts, regional permeability variations, baffles, rock com-pressibility, residual gas saturation and connectivity &amp; in-place volume of minor thin bed facies observed in some wells (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">In the current work, bottom-hole pressures (and where unavailable, tubing head pressures) for all the production wells were set as mismatch parameters for the calculation of the “Global” objective value. The “Standard Deviation” was set to 50. This value was back calculated by aiming to have the “Partial” objective value (“Base Value” in the blue box in Fig. 8) close to 1 for a very well matched case. This allowed the capability of inferring the quality of future history matches from the “Base Value” reported by the software. Correspondingly, at these settings, a reservoir model with near perfect matches for every well was expected to have a “Global” close to the number of mismatch parameters times number of wells active in the case (in this case, it equals to “Global” of 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">A key parameter correlation analysis result is presented in Fig 9. It highlights the presence of a strong and meaningful V-shaped trend between the field in-place and “Global” objective value. Such a trend is not unexpected where the key volumetric uncertainties have been adequately scoped, and, where the field satisfies a key criterion that there are no majorly unconnected hydrocarbons. Physically, this trend is very meaningful and indicates that the connected gas in-place (primary pressure support) for this field must lie within a certain range to adequately represent the reservoir behaviour (represented by low “Global” values).</p><div id="link-9">

The efficiency of the proxy workflow enables hundreds of proxy reservoir simulations to be run in a short time. The proxy model generation needs a training set of experiments for conditioning and robust predictivity and LHC scoping experiments were used for this. Out of 400 LHC scoping runs, top 150 cases with the lowest global value were selected for training a robust proxy (Fig. 14).</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr21">However, LHC typically has poor history matches since it is not designed for matching. On the other hand, MCMC is used as an effective assisted history matching technique but it has been observed in this study that matched cases tend to converge towards a high confidence and narrower volumetric range. Thus, the full set of cases (MCMC and LHC cycles) was pooled and an optimum filtering criterion applied to shortlist matches. This offered the best balance between covering a wide range of volumes and uncertainties and selecting higher quality matches. The combined 720 unfiltered cases show (Fig. 16) the familiar trend of volumetric convergence.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr22">Filtered cases were used to stochastically define the P10 – P50 – P90 volumes and an acceptable cut-off was defined. A cut-off of “Global” &lt; 50 was chosen, based on Fig. 17, to balance good matches with wider volume ranges. This was done as a higher “Global” cut-off of 100 did not add any more value in terms of widening the volumetric ranges but a tighter cut-off of 10 reduced the volumetric spread.</p><div id="link-22">
