<p id="Ancr3">Particularly, the CO2 gas is preferred for injection because it attains high volumetric sweep efficiency with high microscopic displacement efficiency, especially in miscible injection mode. Additionally, the high volumetric sweep efficiency assures delaying CO2 breakthrough to the producer(s) (Rao, 2012). Delaying or eliminating the gas breakthrough results in diminishing concurrent gas-liquid flow, which then leads to increased gas injectivity and maintains the injection pressure. Figure 1 illustrates the basic concepts of the GAGD process(Rao, 2012).</p><div id="link-1">

For the training jobs, the proxy model was then built considering the second-order polynomial equation. After that, the verification jobs were iteratively generated and evaluated by the built proxy model and the reservoir simulator to check whether their values lie within the 95%confidence interval, as shown in Figure 9 that depicts the four different iterations of the polynomial proxy model verification.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">After validating the optimization process, verifying the proxy models, and determining the optimal production factors that affect obtaining the maximum flow response, the optimal solution was then identified and visualized with respect to the field cumulative oil production, as were outlines in Figure 14. The optimal solution represents the maximum field cumulative oil production by the end of the 10 years prediction period. The general solutions in Figure 14, represented by the green curves, refer to the least flow response that combine low and/or poor combinations of the factors' levels. Hence, they led to low levels of field cumulative oil production.</p><div id="link-14">
