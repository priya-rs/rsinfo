<p id="Ancr5">Mode I extension fractures are very common in outcrop maps. Ferrill et al. (2014) outlines the outcrop maps for the Eagle Ford Formation. Fig. 1 shows the west pavement of the mapped outcrop. Bed I, II and III show very well formed fracture networks, which contributes to well production if being hydraulically fractured. Fractures in Bed I is composed of two main fracture sets.</p><div id="link-1">

After 0.1 day’s production (Fig. 12), fractures around the horizontal wellbore are depleted. Because nonuniform fracture apertures are assigned to the fracture network, some fracture gridblocks show the behavior of finite fracture conductivity, and thus much lower pressure values.</p><div id="link-12">

This is because when we duplicated the digitized map to the whole reservoir scale, there might exist some fractures disconnected around the boundaries. One possible solution is to tweak the reservoir boundaries of each pattern a little bit, making sure these fractures cross the boundaries.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr27">Fracture permeabilities are recomputed based on the Cubic law. After remeshing, four new cases are simulated with the same reservoir, rock, and fluid properties. Cumulative oil and production rate are plotted on Fig. 23 and Fig. 24. With the increase of fracture mineralization, fracture aperture decreases, resulting in significant reduction in cumulative oil production. The recovery oil decreases from the original around 6 MSTB to 3 MSTB when nonuniform fracture apertures are decreased to 0.2 times of the original values.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr29">Fig. 25 compares the nonuniform fracture apertures with uniform fracture apertures that are derived from three different averaging approaches. The arithmetic method gives us the best cumulative oil production that is followed by the base case, geometric average, and harmonic average in Fig. 25. Even though we do observe a considerable difference between nonuniform and uniform fracture apertures, the cumulative oil curve of nonuniform fracture apertures is bounded by arithmetic and harmonic averaging approaches.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr30">Fig. 26 shows a plot of oil production rates for five hydraulically fractured horizontal wells in Eagle Ford formation. This plot is prepared from a public database (e.g., DrillingInfo). The well API numbers are listed on the legend. The red curve shows an averaged oil production profile. Note that there is a peak production rate around 100 days, which might be due to flowback of fracturing water.</p><div id="link-26">
