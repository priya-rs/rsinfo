Figure 1(b) also shows the schematic of an example well configuration and the installation of the fiber optic capillary tube bundles (FOCTB) clamped to the tubing for steam injection flow profiling.

<p id="Ancr4">The intent of this installation was to gain mechanical/operational experience installing fiber optic in horizontal steam injectors before installing a higher-cost, customized, Incoloy 825, fiber optical capillary tube bundle (FOCTB). After installing the fiber and returning well "A" to steam injection, DTS data was successfully acquired during the first 24 hours. The MM fiber was interrogated a week later, and it was unexpected to find the fiber failed at the measured depth of 1847 feet in heel region at the lowest true vertical depth (TVD) of the well path, Figure 3.Figure 3 (c) shows chloride stress corrosion on a piece of capillary tube that was retrieved from 1847 feet in well "A".</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The accumulated water was initially fresh at ~400 ppm total dissolved solids (TDS) and ~150 ppm chloride concentration. As the water was continuously boiled off by the high temperature steam inside the tubing, at 380 °F in the heel region, the TDS and chlorides concentration increased to saturation point and eventually deposited as a solid salt scale in the tubing-casing annulus. Figure 4 is a photo of the scale deposited on the outside of the tubing at the lowest TVD location in well "A". It can be clearly seen in Figure 4 that the scale deposition is occurring on the low-side of the wellbore.</p><div id="link-4">

As a result, DTS can show various temperature values corresponding to different locations at the circumference of the tubing. In more detail, Figure 12 shows that depending on the location of the fiber, the tubing temperature, annulus temperature, liner or reservoir temperature can be detected in the DTS data. Although wrapping the fibers around the tubing introduces more complexity to the interpretation of the DTS data, it helps to capture the full cross section of fluid dynamics effects in the wellbore.</p><div id="link-12">

Figure 13 shows the temperature profiles in well "A" before injection startup and 6 days after installing the fiber in the well. This well had been shut down for the workover. During the shutdown period, quenching water had been pumped to the well for safety reasons. As Figure 13 shows, the quenching water rapidly warms up after installing the fiber and discontinuing pumping the water. The largest amount of temperature rise is seen in the horizontal section where steam injection has occurred.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">Using the DTS fluctuation characteristics in the space domain, Figure 14 compares the temperature and temperature gradient in well "A" and well "B". In both wells after 4 hours of data acquisition the steam quality was increased to 95%. As Figure 14 shows, Well "B" has more liquid phase in the lateral than Well "A". In Well "B" the majority of the vapor phase is in the heel zone. Well "A" has more vapor distributed along the lateral. In the toe region of both wells there is more liquid phase as steam loses heat before reaching to the toe. It can also be seen that increasing steam quality at the wellhead of both wells increases the temperature values and the steam vapor phase in the horizontal section.</p><div id="link-14">

As can be seen, the first three FCDs show significant amount of continuous acoustic energy at the depth of 2200, 2380, and 2600 feet. The last FCD at 2750 feet, however, has a pattern of high amplitude acoustic energy slugs propagating to the toe of the wellbore.

Each FCD mandrel has four ports in 90 degree phasing. Figure 18 depicts the wellbore schematics for well "A" and well "B" with four and three FCDs, respectively. In Figure 18, high frequency DAS data was plotted for 60 seconds of data. Using the high frequency band of the DAS data spectrogram, very high amplitude acoustic energy is observed from the three FCDs of well "A", however, the last FCD does not have significant acoustic energy.</p><div id="link-18">

The power spectral density (PSD) of the DAS data versus frequency is plotted for each channel close to the FCDs. As can be seen, several harmonic frequencies are observed in Figure 19, which is associated with the acoustic characterization of different nozzle sizes. A deconvolution algorithm was applied to the acoustic power of each FCD to find the frequency characterization of each nozzle size. Table 1 shows the harmonic frequencies of three different nozzle sizes that were used in well "A". Similar frequencies were also observed in well "B".</p><div id="link-19">
