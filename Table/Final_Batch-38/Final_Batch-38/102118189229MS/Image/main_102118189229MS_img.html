<p id="Ancr2">Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) has been producing oil from the Upper Burgan formation for over 60 years from the Raudhatain and Sabriyah oil fields of North Kuwait (Figure 1). Both fields are essentially very large dome shaped anticlines that have been highly faulted and are structurally complex. Raudhatain Upper Burgan is North Kuwait’s prolific producer under active water flood as well as with natural edge water drive. It’s a mature Reservoir with water cut all over the field but still with lot of production potential.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Raudhatain Upper Burgan (UB) is a multilayer clastic reservoir in North Kuwait under active waterflood since 2000. With four major flow units, poor sweep efficiency often results from spatial variation and/or heterogeneity in the permeability of the reservoir rock. These major and well-known different units, prevent the conventional analysis of Voidage Replacement Ratio (VRR) as other conventional reservoirs (Figure 2). The initial completion design did not address the injection profile control and the majority of water was going to the unit UB5.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The Upper Burgan Formation is the uppermost unit of the Burgan Formation. The Burgan Formation was deposited during the Albian period (Early Cretaceous) time and it is overlain by Mauddud Formation and underlain by Shuaiba Formation (Figure 3). The Upper Burgan reservoir is encountered at vertical depths of ~ 7600 feet at the crest of the structure in the Raudhatain field. The Upper Burgan reservoir in the Raudhatain field is approximately 160 feet thickness and the thickness varies in different parts of the field.</p><div id="link-3">

The UB3 and UB2 layers however are thicker and often exhibit blocky or fining upwards sequences. These deposits are the fluvial dominated delta channel facies and are the highest reservoir quality rocks in the Upper Burgan Formation. The reservoir quality varies and is largely dependent on the rock type and depositional facies.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr24">The first implementation of WFR in Raudhatain Filed has proved the concept of improving vertical injection profile by enabling higher injection rates into layers that never received water before and regulating the distribution into all layers. As most of the water injected into the well (more than 70%) was traversing through one zone only before the job, the vertical distribution of injected water due to WFR approach resulted in choking the flow through this layer to about 60% and improve the flow through the remaining uncontacted layers like summirized in Table 1 and Figure 23.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr25">In order to monitor the benefit, a survaillance plan was defined to track that increase of production and reserves by performing frequent PGOR tests and scheduling for PLT for the producers. Some of the preliminary well-testing showed increase of oil production after installing the WFR. In addition to that, monitoring the pump intake preussure as shown in Figure 24 was very important to see if reservoir pressure will increase in the offset producers.</p><div id="link-24">
