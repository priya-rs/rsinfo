<p id="Ancr1">Unconventional clastic reservoir distributes over more than 1200 Km2 area in Kuwait at shallow reservoir depths varying from 450-750 ft. The reservoir generally consists of two sandstone units Zone-1 and Zone-2 separated by a mid-shale unit. However, intervening siltstone and shale units often divide the two sandstone units into four stratified reservoir units of Zone-1A and Zone-1B, and Zone-2A and Zone-2B zones as shown in Fig. 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Every zone show a discrepancy in net pay thickness from 10 to 30 feet making it a challenging target for thermal enhanced oil recovery. There are significant variation in the north and south areas of the field in which viscous oil property shows considerable variation both laterally as well as vertically (Sanyal and Al-Sammak, 2011). The crude turn out to be denser and more viscous from top to bottom vertically, and north to south aerially. The location map of the CSS wells is shown in Fig. 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">All these wells were drilled vertically up to +/-1100 feet covering entire reservoir. The wells have a two casing policy with 9 5/8” casing landing in cap shale at +/-550 feet and 7” casing cemented up to surface. The cementing in both casing strings has been performed with thermal cement. Fig.4 shows wellbore schematics of a typical CSS well including the tubing and casing grade.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">In addition, the downhole gauges provide valuable data to monitor the downhole injection pressure during steaming. Downhole thermal gauges are utilized to perform transient test analysis, pressure fall off post steam injection and post-production pressure build-ups. Fig. 5 demonstrates a pressure fall off test in one of the steaming operation. Transient test data is being utilized to optimize steam operation including designing steam slug.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">The cementing in both casing strings has been performed with 15.5 PPG thermal cement. The Cement Bond Log (CBL) is recorded in all the wells before the start of steaming and post steaming after each cycle to understand any cement deterioration post steaming. Also, the casing is pressurized to confirm the integrity. Cement evaluation from Cement bond logs show good bonding in most of the wells post steaming as shown in Fig. 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">In the cyclic steam stimulation wells temperature are recorded for the temperature profile prior to steaming to have a base reference. The temperature surveys are also done during the steam injection phase and soaking phase to understand the steam movement behind the well bore which in turn will give indication on the well integrity and the steam movement in the formation. Fig. 7 shows the temperature surveys which was recorded at different time in one of the pilot well confirming that most of the steam had gone in the zone of interest.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">The plan is to further optimize the cleaning method by utilizing concentric coil tubing (CCT) and the trial is planned in one of the pilot wells. The acquired information helps us estimate the produced sand from the well which will assist in optimizing well completion for commercial application.

<p id="Ancr9">The completion design of pilot wells has the philosophy of sand management versus sand control. Sand management is achieved by adopting different perforation strategy and optimizing the pump operating parameters like stroke length, strokes per minute, pump settling depth etc. To monitor the sanding behavior of the well we run drive down bailer (DDB) on slick line to tag the sand depth and collect the sand samples to perform particle analysis. Based on the tag depth, a sand clean out is performed by utilizing a CTU if necessary (see Fig.9 and 10).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Production logging is utilized to estimate steam injection profile for single or multi-zone completion case. The spinner data is being used to further optimize completion for future steamflood operation. Steam injection in different pilot wells indicated steam tendency to override. Steam distribution mechanical devices is needed to distribute steam evenly and proportionally to zone net pay. Fig. 11 is a field example of one of the pilot wells where injection were performed in multi-zone.</p><div id="link-11">
