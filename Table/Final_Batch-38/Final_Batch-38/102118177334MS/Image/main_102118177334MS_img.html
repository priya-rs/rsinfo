<p id="Ancr2">For example, the extension of a cross-linked polymer gels injection program to cover fully sweeped porous layers in order to achieve natural fractures colmatation and a sweep efficiency increase while there are no natural fractures, can lead to unpredictable results after several years. Field development options are formed based on EOR activities, aimed to maximize each of the considered factors. Then best option is chosen based on economic analysis and iterative improvement of options using simulation model. The following factors affecting RF are considered in this article (Figure 1):</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">One of the approaches to analogue identification for RF evaluation is described in the paper (Wickens et.al., 2010). This approach is based on the calculation of field [1]complexity[1] index, which is a sum of four parameters, depending on oil viscosity, vertical heterogeneity, oil in place for the area unit, reservoir geology (faults, unconformities). Therefore the higher is the index, the more [1]complex[1] is the field. It should be noted that structure factor of scoring is based on United Kingdom Continental Shelf and the United States fields. Figure 3 represents the actual data of achieved RF depending on summary field complexity index.</p><div id="link-3">

Distribution of resources by types and production costs according to IEA are presented at Figure 24. It should be noted that production cost for EOR is lower than production cost for shale oil.</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr31">his EOR method is a combination of waterflooding with alkali, surfactant and polymer (Figure 30). Surfactant is needed to decrease dramatically interfacial tension to values of 10-3 mN/m and mobilize capillary trapped oil according to capillary desaturation curve. Alkali is added in order to reduce surfactant adsorption on the grains and lower therefore the usage of the most expensive component of solution. Another positive effect of alkali is related with a soap production in-place (surfactant) which is caused by chemical reaction between alkali and oil. Polymer allows to stabilize the displacement front and improve the sweeping of microemulsions in the reservoir.</p><div id="link-30">
