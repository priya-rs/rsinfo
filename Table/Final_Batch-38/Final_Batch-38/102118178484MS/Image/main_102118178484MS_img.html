<p id="Ancr2">Three different oil water contacts (POWC) were logged during the production life. This is as a result of two saddles which separate the structure into three highs (Figure 1). This has led to three distinct accumulations (sectors) with the same connected acquifer. The reservoir in case 2 from a different field is one which has intra-reservoir shales that segregated the reservoir into three distinct geological units as captured in the Petrophysical Data Log (PDL) (Figure 12). The fluid in the shallowest unit is gas. Oil is in the middle unit and water in the deepest unit.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The multi-tank models provided the contact variation in the geological units for both cases. This is captured in the cross section (Figure 2) for case 1 which shows that the central and eastern sectors have different POWCs. This provided a more robust analysis for the perforation optimization (water shut-off) for both cases as captured in the petrophysical data logs through the wells of interest (Figures 9 and 12)</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The MBAL plots in figures 3 &amp; 4 capture the workflow for the central and eastern sectors (accumulations) in case 1; while figure 13 captures that for case 2. The MBAL model was calibrated with available Carbon-Oxygen (C/O) log data and subsequently used to predict contact movement for the reservoirs. The calibration shows a good match between the C/O log data and the models as seen in figures 5, 6 and 14. There is a good match between the simulated and historical pressure trends as seen in figures 7, 8 and 15.</p><div id="link-3">
