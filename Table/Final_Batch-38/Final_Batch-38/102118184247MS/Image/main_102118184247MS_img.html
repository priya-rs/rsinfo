<p id="Ancr1">The DAZ field is located in the Niger Delta depositional basin. It has elongate NW-SE rollover anticline with collapsed crest. The field is densely faulted by a conjugate system of synthetic and antithetic faults forming the main structural elements of the collapsed crest (Fig 1). The reservoir (DAZ 1) of focus in this review has over 5 years of production history.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The Gross Rock Volume is a factor of the Hydrocarbon height and drainage area. The hydrocarbon height is the Oil Column (OC) available for production to the well perforation. The hydrocarbon height is as logged by the well (Figure 2). The Oil Column Height available for production to well A1 is fairly the same Oil Column Height available for nearby producers B1 and C1 (Figure 2). The DAZ-1 reservoir is observed to be strongly aquifer driven with very weak gas expansion.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The focus of recovery volume estimation presented in this paper is DAZA1 well. DAZ A1 well was drilled and completed on DAZ-1 reservoir. The well is yet to be hooked up for production. DAZ A1 well is in close proximity to two other wells; DAZ B1 and C1- Figure 3. The DAZ B1 and C1 wells have already been hooked up and producing for over 5 years.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The streamlines for each well were used to guide the drainage area pattern and size (Figure 4 and 5). This drainage area then formed the basis of the recoverable volume calculation for well A1. The same method was then repeated for the producing wells B1 and C1; the results were supported by production from these wells. It was determined that dynamically guided volumetric evaluation using streamlines is best suited for volume estimation for Well A1 in reservoir DAZ-1 setting</p><div id="link-4">
