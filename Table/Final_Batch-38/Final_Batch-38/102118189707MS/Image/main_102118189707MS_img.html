<p id="Ancr4">The well was landed in the Lower Marcellus with some significant footage spent in the Cherry Valley Limestone also. Three faults are noted in the well geosteering diagram displayed in Fig. 2. The bottom hole assembly used to drill the 4,000-foot lateral section included an 8 ½ inches polycrystalline diamond bit, a bent sub, and a positive displacement mud motor. Each of the mentioned items can affect the calculated MSE values and are important to denote before the analysis begins.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The calculations were performed by hand for this analysis, though the process could be improved through additional automation and application of artificial intelligence algorithms. The resulting MSE values have been plotted on the wellbore in Fig. 3. The variations in MSE immediately show heterogeneity through what geosteering would define as a homogeneous section. These variations in rock strength could be detrimental if a geometric completion design is applied throughout the lateral without proper consideration.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Initial comparisons of the MSE calculations to the sonic derived UCS show a relative correlation across the entire lateral. Plotting the values beside each other, as seen in Fig. 4, immediately indicates possible issues at several depths concerning the MSE calculation. From 8,000 to 8,200 feet there is an obvious conflict between the drilling information and the logging suite. The trend of both datasets is similar, yet the depths of the UCS seem to be compressed when compared to the MSE calculation in this interval.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr11">An example of the binning and contributing clusters is shown in Fig. 7. The coloring of the cells represents the MSE values, while the numbers within the cells represent the top measured depth of the perforation cluster. The scale used to bin MSE values is shown on the right of Fig. 7. As an example, stage 7 has a contributing cluster calculation of three due to clusters 4, 5, and 6 sharing the lowest MSE values within that zone. Alternatively, stage 11 has only one cluster (cluster 3) in the lowest MSE bin, but with the above assumption on feasibility and perforation friction, stage 11 is given a contributing cluster count of two.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">Results for each of the wells are available in table 2. A plot showing the relationship of contributing clusters to the one-year cumulative gas production is also shown in Fig. 8. A linear trend starts to develop between the well productivity and the estimated number of contributing clusters. An outlier to the trend is the Broadwater 1MH. The author believes that well spacing may have a greater influence on well productivity within the first year.</p><div id="link-10">
