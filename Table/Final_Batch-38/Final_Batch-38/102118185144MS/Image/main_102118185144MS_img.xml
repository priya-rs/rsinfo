<anchoringText id="Ancr9">The instrumentation requirement to calculate flowrate and PHI is limited to six analog signals, which are summarized in Fig. 6. The power equation can therefore easily be applied to existing ESP wells equipped with a gauge, which provides real time intake and discharge pressure, which is the case for many of the wells operated by Khalda. This was an important consideration because it allowed historical data to be post processed, thereby providing the full production history from the time of the ESP installation. For the 4 field trial wells, the only required additional instrumentation was a digital wellhead pressure gauge, which was retrofitted on two out of the four trial wells to enable both water (WC) and PHI calculation in real time.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">Because the algorithm does not require any iterative calculations, it lends itself to being programed into an engine, which can service multiple wells with high frequency data e.g. updates twice per minute, which is equivalent to 1 million points per year per analogue signal. This was one of the aspects that was tested during the field trial (i.e. testing whether liquid rate and WC could be delivered to the production and reservoir engineer’s desk in real time via the Internet). This was proven during this field trial as was also the case during another field trial documented by Camilleri et al. (ADIPEC 2016). The IT architecture deployed is shown in Fig 8. and has the advantage that it can receive and send data to any historian.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr16">The calculated rate showed a good match over the life of the ESP. In the second half of the life of the ESP, there are several well test points, which are 5 to 10% lower than the calculated rate. These were believed to be inaccurate because the ESP PHI was equal to 1.0 during this time suggesting that there is no need to recalibrate. In fact, liquid rate calculation was calibrated using the PHI as real-time WHP was available in the second half of the ESP life. This provided an excellent match with the test separator data from the first half of the ESP life, which corroborated the hypothesis that there was a lack of repeatability in the test separator data and that the calculated rate provided greater repeatability than the test separator. The PHI calculation is shown both versus time in Fig. 9 as well as on the pump curve in Fig. 13.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr17">One of the natural byproducts of using the power equation for the liquid rate calculation is that a calibrated motor model is made available to calculate the motor-generated power. The model takes into consideration the changes in motor winding saturation as voltage is modified, thereby providing an estimate of the product of power factor (PF) and motor efficiency (ηm) at all times. This means that it is possible to calculate the voltage that would minimize the current and thereby minimize both consumed power and motor operating temperature without any change in pump frequency and production. An example of such real-time calculations is shown in Fig 14.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr18">Initially WC calculations were only performed on WKAL-A4 and SIWA-3R6 because they were the only two wells fitted with real-time WHP gauges. As with liquid rate, although initial calibration requires a physical measurement, subsequently the calculated WC had greater repeatability as shown in Fig. 15 for well WKAL-A4. What can be seen on this graph is that there is an equal scatter of field measured WC around a steadily rising mean calculated by the PCL algorithm, especially when the real time wellhead pressure readings are available in the second half of the ESP life.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr19">WC is measured using wellhead samples, which are then sent to a laboratory for analysis following heat treatment and centrifugal separation of oil and water phases. Despite this process, there is always some uncertainty in the WC readings because of emulsions as well as water being trapped in the oil phase even after lab treatment. In such cases, the operator has to rely on an approximate assumption on how to split the emulsion between oil and water, which is shown in Fig. 16. Repeatability is aggravated by unstable well conditions such as slugging which means that wellhead samples are not representative of the inflow but rather of what reaches the surface. The advantage of basing the WC on the tubing pressure drop is that oil-water separation is not required.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr20">What this equation demonstrates is that when points lie on a straight line, then the drainage area depletion ("B" value) and well PI (including skin effect) are constant for that period of time. Conversely a change in inflow parameters can also be detected. An illustration of the application of this equation is shown in Fig. 17 for well WKAL-A4. After three months of production, one detects both depletion and repressurisation in alternate sequence, which is corroborated by the fact that the nearby injector was turned on and off at the same time and one can observe directly the reaction in the producer.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr27">Having downhole high-frequency flowrate available, makes PTA potentially possible in drawdown thereby avoiding build-ups. This was tried on several wells both within this trial and by the authors on other wells and proved to be a valid statement. The example shown in Fig. 24 is for the initial drawdown in NRZK-16 has a noisy log-log plot during IARF. This is a common problem when performing drawdown analysis using an ESP gauge which has a resolution of only 0.1 psi.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr28">Similar PTA drawdown analysis was performed for WRZK-82 and shown in Fig. 25 and in this case there is no skin. It is interesting to note that one can observe the constant pressure boundary caused by the nearby water injection well, which corroborates the fact that flowing pressures observed during production varied as a function of injection being turned on and off.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr29">The frequency changes and choke movements provide the production engineer with multirate tests that can be used to plot an IPR curve and thereby estimate reservoir pressure and PI. Fig. 26 illustrates how this was achieved for well WKAL-A4. Because of the high frequency, high repeatability and high resolution of the calculated rate, one can detect small changes in stabilised flowrate which occurred over a short period of less than one month due to a change in speed and a choke movement.</anchoringText>
