<p id="Ancr2">F1-2 formation is composed of three areally overlapping lenses F1L0, F1L1 and F2 (fig. 2), which were formed over different cycles of deposition. Migration of gas to the lenses could also take place by stages. A hypothesis was put forward that gas condensate content varies from lens to lens. The changing ratio of permeability and net pay of lenses in different wells leads to the areal variations of gas condensate content.</p><div id="link-2">

Consequently, the hypothesis about differing gas composition in lenses was not substantiated for the tested wells.

<p id="Ancr5">To solve the first task an analysis was carried out to suggest geological factors that might account for the compartmentalization of the area. The most prominent one was the presence of faults, which were identified by the analysis of the seismic data during the appraisal. These faults were not incorporated into the simulation model previously for the lack of evidence that they were impermeable (fig. 5).</p><div id="link-5">

This suggestion is corroborated by the well-test analysis, indicating a pressure barrier at the distance from well 7 corresponding to its distance to one of the mentioned faults. The "blue" border was also considered to follow the line of the longitudinal fault to the west without connection to the latitudinal fault (pink line in fig. 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">It is important to note, that for each of the considered boundaries variations and choice of gas composition for the central (transitional) zone the full history matching of simulation model had to be done. Having in mind the numerous history matching runs (for each of the 8 combinations of zone boundaries and gas composition in the transitional zone) the process of history matching had to be thoroughly optimized. It was described in the form of a diagram (fig. 10) and a special method for simultaneous well matching was developed.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">The method for simultaneous well matching involved calculation of simulation error (for formation and bottom-hole flowing pressures and gas cumulative production) for each well, selection of the biggest one and using empirical correlation formulae to convert it to a multiplication coefficient for either permeability (for formation pressure or gas cumulative production errors) or fracture half-length (for flowing pressure errors) – fig. 11. The nature of the correlation was established empirically based on "manual" matching of several wells.</p><div id="link-11">
