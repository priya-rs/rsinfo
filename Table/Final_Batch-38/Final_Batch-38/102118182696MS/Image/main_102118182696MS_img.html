<p id="Ancr1">Peace River Pad 31 is a bitumen site in Alberta, Canada operated with a vertical steam drive system, although other production methods have been used in the past. Predicting production at this site is a difficult task due to geological parameter uncertainties, thermal physics that can be time consuming to computationally model, and extreme lateral heterogeneity due to previous production as indicated by seismic time shifts within the reservoir over a four month period shown in Figure 1 (Przybysz-Jarnut et al. 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">At Peace River Pad 31 operators control well pump rates, X1, but we have other measurements of the field, Y1, (e.g. temperatures, pressures, seismic) influenced by X1 and that affect production, Y2. We propose a two-step method outlined in Figure 2:</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Some machine learning methods require missing data to be filled in, so we created automated scripts to linearly interpolate any measurement missing 4 or fewer contiguous days of data. If more than 4 contiguous days were missing, these days were automatically excluded. Days with low injector flow rates were flagged as less reliable, as seen in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<figcaption><b>Figure 4 </b> Production predictions using data from the first 80% of days based on a Lasso model assuming pressures, temperatures and other observations were exactly predicted (left) without seismic, and (right) with ten representatives polygons hand-selected from the seismic images. The true weekly average oil production (blue line) stays close to the training data fit (blue dots), and predicts an overall downward trend but also predicts some upticks in production that did not occur (green dots). These results also included the rates of change of each measurement, which seemed to help fit the data better, but doubled the dimension. The seismic polygons helped, but were not as good as PCA-compressed seismic.</figcaption>

<p id="Ancr5">To test whether and how to incorporate daily seismic survey data, we ran predictions without seismic, with seismic represented by time-shift averages within 10 expert-selected polygons, and with seismic compressed using principal component analysis (PCA). Fast decay of the singular values associated with the top 10 principal components justified restricting our reduced seismic images to the span of the10 largest principal components of the training days' images. An example of seismic images projected onto the top 10 components of a longer period of time can be seen in Figure 5. Different components react differently to various events in the field.</p><div id="link-5">
