The project targets three main stratigraphic sequences (Figure 1). The top interval is unconsolidated and had been lost in the majority of the cores. We have been able to run corefloods in the reservoir material from the two bottom intervals (Figure 1) that are more consolidated but still friable (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr16">Because it helps to understand the reservoir and interpret the results. Moreover, it is a tool to conceptualise multiple strategies. The utility factor of the pilot is 2.9 kg per incremental barrel of oil above waterflooding (Figure 15) which indicates in combination with the water cut curve that the project could still improve (decrease the utility factor). Also, the utility factor is a technical criteria for monitoring and optimisation.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr17">After injecting less than 0.15 pore volumes of 2500/3000ppm polymer we recovered 11% ooip incremental oil above waterflooding from the central pattern (Figure 16b) and 6.2% of the ooip from offset producers in contacted zone (Figure 16c). The water cut reduced from 90% to 45% in the confined producer and from 87% to 67% in the nine offset producers (Figure 14b). Water cut reduction is greater than best pilots in the literature (Figure 14b). This can be explained because of the cross flow between fluvial layers in the inter-well region showing very good vertical connectivity (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr20">Figure 19 displays the reservoir simulation prediction using polymer resistance factor for the plateau regime and newtonian model for polymer resistance factor in each cell. The simulation underpredict the oil rate however the predictions are accurate, free from numerical instabilities and convergence problems that lead to wrong numerical solutions in many EOR simulations when including shearthinning and shearthickening rheology models and erroneous newtonian viscosity as assuming newtonian viscosity equal to laboratory measurements at 1 ft/day. Note that, just after polymer injection started we increased the production regime in the confined well; the water cut increased immediately and demonstrated the predictivity of the simulation model (Figure 19b). Then, the polymer response was well capture, oil rate raised and water rate declined even when increasing the gross rate.</p><div id="link-19">
