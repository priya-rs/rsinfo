<p id="Ancr1">La Cira Infantas (LCI) field is a mature oil field located in the Middle Magdalena Valley Basin in northern Colombia as seen in Figure 1. LCI field was discovered in 1918 and has been operating for 100 years. Primary depletion began in 1918 until 1959 when the first water flooding process started.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">In 2005, Occidental de Colombia and Ecopetrol initiated a joint venture of a new redeveloped water flooding process for LCI field. The redevelopment is currently ongoing for 13 years. The water flooding project was implemented in the C-sands of the Mugrosa formation. The Mugrosa formation, as seen in Figure 2, is the main producer of hydrocarbon in La Cira Infantas field and is defined as an interbedding of sandstones, shales and siltstones.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Prior to the redevelopment, the first approach to the water flooding process spanned for 46 years. The two phases of the water flooding process differentiate from each other by distinct recovery approaches and completion methods. As depicted in Figure 3, the first water flooding process was based on line drive arrangements, 30-acre to 40-acre patterns, 5-spot to 7-spot inverted patterns and single string completions for injector wells. Since the redevelopment, the field has expanded to 400 patterns and 1,000 active producer wells, 95% of which are under water flooding process.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">The second plot concentrates on the evaluation of the current flood efficiency. It is important to keep in mind that the efficiency is expected to change as the flood process matures. As indicated by the continuous line in Figure 8 (prototype reference line), the utilization has a maximum value at the beginning of the injection process during the fill up process. When water displaces oil towards producer wells, the utilization decreases rapidly reaching a minimum value right before water breakthrough. After water breakthrough, water cut will gradually increase, likewise increasing the utilization, and the water flood efficiency will decrease. </p><div id="link-8">

Similarly to what is observed on Plot # 3 or Figure 9, the relationship between IWR values and utilization tends to be linear and direct. The effect of high IWR values, or overbalanced condition, is more significant on patterns efficiency compared to having underbalanced conditions or IWR &lt; 1. Very high IWR values are commonly observed when injection is lost outside of the pattern, which refers to a portion of the injected volume not being effective, increasing utilization.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr26">If a pattern is overbalanced, it is important to identify opportunities that will increase the current extraction in producer wells. As shown in Figure 26, the area on the left represents current water cut for producer wells and the color of the injector well represents current utilization for that pattern. The area on the right represents current dynamic fluid levels on the producer wells. High dynamic fluid levels in producer wells and corresponding low utilization values in a pattern represent an opportunity to increase fluid extraction.</p><div id="link-26">

<p id="Ancr27">In patterns where workover jobs have been executed in producer wells it is important to validate that there is injection support in the corresponding sand units in order to see the expected response of incremental oil production. This variable allows identifying opportunities to increase injection rate and to improve the injection support in these new sands. A status map of the executed jobs in LCI field is used to identify patterns with an opportunity to increase injection rate and injectors with an opportunity to perforate new intervals. Figure 27 is an example of the status map for one area of the field.</p><div id="link-27">
