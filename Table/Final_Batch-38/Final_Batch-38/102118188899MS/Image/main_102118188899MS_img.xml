<anchoringText id="Ancr3">The integration of a combined data interpretation from the seismologist, the geologist and the reservoir engineer pointed out at the existence of some non-obvious patterns of partially sealing faults in one of the three commingled reservoirs (Figure 1 and Ref.4). The identification of such features was a key element when constructing an integrated field subsurface model that was able to accurately match historical production and pressure data (Figure 2). Such data integration and modelling provided a robust explanation for the observed poor performance early in field life, therefore forming the basis for a new full Field Development Plan. Seismic, core and production data were looked at jointly raising the level of mutual awareness of each discipline.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">For the same field, the collocation and close collaboration of reservoir engineers and concept engineers allowed defining an optimal surface development where pipelines and compression requirements are represented in an integrated network model involving input from the two disciplines (Figure 3). The optimal development scheme from a subsurface and surface standpoint is defined and selected jointly with mutual awareness of the implications of all the choices made in terms of subsurface recovery, back pressures on the wells, pipeline length, costs, construction timeline and impact on existing facilities. Through this close collaboration individuals from both disciplines develop their knowledge and skills in areas that are traditionally not part of their standard skill development and training program.</anchoringText>
