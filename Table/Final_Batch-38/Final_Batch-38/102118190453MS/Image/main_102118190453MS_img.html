<p id="Ancr2">It is well established in the surfactant science literature that surfactants in water, having hydrophobic and hydrophilic (literally water hating and water loving) parts in the same molecule, tend to self-aggregate at or above the critical micelle concentration (CMC) to minimise the overall free energy of the system. As a result, a surfactant transitions through several highly ordered phases as its concentration is increased [10-13]. These structures range from individual spherical micelles, on the nanometer scale, to packed rod-like structures which are much larger, see Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Figure 2 shows a gel diagram example for a blend of surfactants, a 3:1 blend of a C12,13- 7PO-sulfate and a C20-24 internal olefin sulfonate, in water. The nature of the blend, whether it is visually a liquid, a flowable gel (discerned by tipping the container to see it flow), or a solid gel, can be seen by making up different concentrations of the blend at temperatures between 0°C and 90°C. For this system at ambient temperature (20°C), a liquid is present &lt;37% AM (easy to handle), a flowable gel 37-52% AM (more difficult to handle), a solid gel 52-65% AM (practically impossible to handle) and a flowable gel phase is re-established &gt;65%AM.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">As reference points to compare the viscosity behavior of surfactant concentrates, Figure 3 shows the viscosity as a function of shear rate of two common foods, liquid honey (a viscous liquid) and smooth peanut butter (a paste). Liquid honey is a useful reference for surfactant concentrates as it is a high viscosity liquid that is still pourable at ambient temperature (20-25°C), its viscosity being around 10,000 cP. In contrast, peanut butter is not pourable and its viscosity climbs to 100,000 cP at a shear rate of 10 s-1. Liquid honey is largely a Newtonian liquid3 whereas peanut butter is non-Newtonian. Shear rate dependency of viscosity of a surfactant concentrate is important as it determines how it should be handled in facilities, for mixing and diluting, and what equipment should be used.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">An additional benefit of mixed surfactant systems, such as high%AM AAS/IOS blends, is that they typically result in lower viscosities than the standalone high AM IOS parent as they take on the more fluid behavior of the AAS component [5]. Figure 9 illustrates this with the viscosity data at 20 and 60°C for a 73% AM AAS/IOS blend consisting of a 3/1 mixture of C12-13 -7PO-sulfate / C20-24 IOS. The high AM blend at 20°C has a viscosity &lt;10,000 cP across the 1 to 100 s-1 shear rate range which can be compared to the HAM C20-24 IOS component (Figure 4b) which has a viscosity &gt;100,000 cP at 10 s-1 at 20°C.</p><div id="link-9">
