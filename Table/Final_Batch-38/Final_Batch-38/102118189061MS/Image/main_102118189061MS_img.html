Net reservoir thickness is generally less than 100 ft. and is expressed as a single loop or multiple loops on seismic. Analysis of reservoir data (logs, cores, and seismic information) indicate that the reservoirs in the field were deposited from lobate and distributive channel deposits to sinuous channel complexes with variable aggradations and/or lateral accretion as illustrated in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

It is a single seismic loop reservoir and mostly below tuning (average net sand in main channel belt ~30ft). The reservoir consists of three NE-SW trending turbidite channel complexes named as Northern-, Central- and Southern- Channel Complexes.</p><div id="link-2">

TVDss was used, based on amplitude shut-off analysis on the 2001 seismic, in the original FDP study. Facies distribution was carried out with established Electro-Facies scheme for Dotun reservoirs based on core data and log responses. The facies types included Channel Storey Axis (CSA), Channel Storey Margin (CSM), Inter-Channel Thin Beds (ICTB) along with Mud Rich Thin Beds (MRTB) or shale (Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Water Breakthrough happened in the P1 well within six months of bringing the well on stream (Figure 4) and the water cut (WC) increased sharply to 50% within a few weeks. An interference test was conducted between the P1 and W1 wells to check for hydraulic connectivity. However, the pressure pulse from the W1 well did not reach the producer even after 2 days of monitoring, against the expected 1.3 days of transmission lag time based on theoretical calculations. Also, the composition analysis on water samples (Table 1) taken from the P1 well, showed that the produced water properties (salinity) are more consistent with the formation water than with the injected seawater.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">As shown in Figure 5, the Iteration 0 model yielded an improved history match specifically in a considerable aquifer influx scenario, but WBT was still roughly 1 year off. Also, it could not adequately replicate the BHP for both the P1 and W1 wells over the history period. This hinted that the model had better reservoir connectivity between the producer-injector pair than actually seen in the wells.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">It was inferred that because of the below tuning nature of the seismic and the presence of the aquifer, the reservoir amplitude in the area between the producer well and the aquifer in the East is not representative of the actual net sand distribution. Hence it was decided to carry out manual facies updates in this area based on conceptual models in an iterative manner till reasonable history match is achieved (described in Table 2 and Figure 6). Each realization yielded incrementally better history-matches (in terms of WBT &amp; WC) than previous iteration.

The robustness of the HM exercise has been validated by actual well performance data (post study) from Sep'17 to Jan'17 (Figure 11) as forecasted from simulation.
