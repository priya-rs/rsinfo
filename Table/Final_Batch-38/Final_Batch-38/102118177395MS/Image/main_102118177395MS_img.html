A clear correlation between well test average FBHT and GOR was established and a linear correlation between these two parameters was demonstrated in Figure 3. As temperature is continuously monitored, it is possible to infer GOR between well tests, and correct the platform gas allocation in the absence of well test data.</p><div id="link-3">

Data from well AzC-8 is shown in Figure 4 to explain the method and shows GOR trends from both sources- that are both allocated and FBHT-estimated. Trends of well test GOR, FBHT-derived GOR, allocated GOR, real-time bottom-hole temperature, and average bottom-hole temperatures measured during production tests are shown. In general, after gas breakthrough, the well is choked back during the tests to accommodate gas in the test separator.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Incorporation of these findings into the reservoir simulation model had yielded encouraging results for the history match. GOR behaviour of the CA SF producers was matched in the simulation model. As seen in Figure 6 significant improvements of GOR match in central Azeri AzC-3 (from 6000 scf/stb to 1000scf/stb), AzC-9 (from 1200 to 4000 scf/stb) and AzC-8 (from 1000 to 7000 scf/stb) were achieved. The Fasila D single zone well AzC-10 match also improved by adding additional perforation in the lower part of Fasila B in the simulation model, which mimicked the behind casing gas flow observed and consequently improved the GOR match.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The 4D seismic survey in CA was acquired in 2007 for the first time and it was then repeated in 2008 and 2010. It provided clear evidence and placement of moved gas oil and oil water contacts in the Fasila B and Fasila D (Figure 9). It established an excellent calibration point for the HM. It provided the only source in early stages of development of the field for flood front monitoring. Despite few attempts only in 2014 injection profile (IPROF) from gas injectors was successfully carried out. And until this data was gathered seismic interpretations was used assuming that injection happens proportionally to Kh values in simulation model. First AzC-11 IPROF and AzA-4 core confirmed that this assumption was close to the reality.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">A 4D survey in EA area was acquired in 2012 (base survey acquired in 1995, Figure 12). It provided valuable information in the very challenging part of the field where historically appraisal drilling and production drilling provided data from only limited areas, but the 4D seismic provided the bigger picture of the area. This provided integrated learnings from individual well and surveillance data in an area of a very uncertain oil-water contact (OWC), including the presence and size of the gas cap.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">In the early stages of Azeri simulation models, the shales were stochastically distributed. These shale maps were developed based on analogue data and using the limited data from the appraisal wells. Further data from drilling new wells, plus water and gas breakthrough in the first production wells, forced a review of these maps. For example, whilst drilling AzW-1 Fasila D well in WA, a water bearing zone was discovered in the middle zone of the Fasila B (Figure 13). After that, shale maps were created (Kuramshina, Feb 2010) using RFT pressure data and logs.</p><div id="link-13">

As AzW-4 well pressure shows (Figure 14) after seven months of injection, the upper Fasila B pressure was 130psi higher than the lower Fasila B.
