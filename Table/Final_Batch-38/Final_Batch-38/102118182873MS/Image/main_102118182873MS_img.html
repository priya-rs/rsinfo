<p id="Ancr3">The initial phase of the development started with early production scheme is 1994, after which injection started in the phase 1 development. Phase III, Transition Zone, Infill development and other development projects are currently planned for the future. Transiton zone which is one of the most challenging areas of the reservoir represents, approximately 20% of the estimated reserves. As such the transition zone was characterize and investigated, in order to define the best development strategy for the AB field. Figure 1 shows the different phases of the AB field development.</p><div id="link-1">
