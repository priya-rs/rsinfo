<p id="Ancr2">The Field-X is operated by an operator in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (MTJDA). The field is located in the northern part of the JDA (Fig. 1), in the Gulf of Thailand. It is located at the northern part of the Malay Basin, 302 km from Songkhla (Thailand) and is 180 km from Kota Bharu (Malaysia). The field was discovered in 2009 through Well-1 drilled down to J-Group after successfully meeting the objective to explore hydrocarbon accumulation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The Malay Basin is elongated in shape and oriented in the north-south direction on the northern part and gradually shifted to the northwest-southeast direction at the main portion. It contains more than eight kilometers thickness of Tertiary sediments, which can be classified into three megasequences (syn-rift, post-rift and regional sagging). The basin was formed during early Tertiary rifting in an intra-cratonic region as a consequence of Indo-Asian plate collision and subsequent tectonic extrusion. The basin evolved and formed a pull-apart rift basin consisting of active and passive basin margins (Madon et al. 2004). Fig. 2 presents the regional cross-section of the MTJDA.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The stratigraphic framework used by the operating company is a genetic sequence based on several flooding surfaces observed in the well, seismic, and sedimentological data. Some of the coal marker is widely distributed and can be considered a good marker to correlate with nearby fields. The depositional sequence was established from A-Group (youngest) to K-Group (oldest) in the area (Fig. 3). The discovered hydrocarbon in this field is primarily gas, sourced from the Oligocene to Early Miocene lacustrine shale and the intraformational lower coastal marine shale.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The geological setting of the North Malay Basin is well-known to exhibit a high temperature gradient (Fig. 4). Apart from the exceptionally high temperature, variation in CO2 presence, near critical reservoir fluids, and low porosity/permeability in deeper horizons compartmentalization are challenges that add to the reservoir complexities. Understanding them allows mitigation of the uncertainty in the field development plan. Furthermore, the objective was to determine the presence of gas and collect fluid samples in deeper targets that have not yet been drilled by exploratory wells where the seismic signature shows encouraging bright anomalies of seismic amplitude of J - Group.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">This paper addresses challenges obtaining reservoir parameters, such as representative formation fluid gradient, proper identification, and characterizing reservoir fluids, and acquiring high quality and low contamination PVT samples in such environments so the operator can measure CO2 content when the downhole fluid sample is drained on the surface. Knowing the CO2 profile from shallow to deep reservoirs, helps optimize production and field development (Fig. 5). The paper then discusses new hostile formation tester tools. Actual field results are discussed with some lessons learned from operations to obtain accurate reservoir fluids in such challenging conditions.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The hostile formation tester has pad options with dual pads that enable two selectable pads to be measured on a single set of the tool. These can be configured to operate individually to increase pad longevity on long operations where many sets are necessary as well as anisotropy interference between the probes spaced 6 inch apart. The tool can also be configured with an oval pad, with a greater flow area for both pressure and sampling (Fig. 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">Formation pressure and fluid samples in hostile environment are crucial in terms of pads and packer elements. The rubber must have the ability to be controlled and deform and reform under stress and compression. The option to use more solid rubber materials to better withstand temperatures leads to materials being more likely to tear and more brittle (Fig. 7). Highly saturated nitrile (HSN) was used as rubber material, which enables the pad to set to the borehole and maintain a good seal for the duration of the test. In hostile environments, and temperatures between 350 (177) and 450°F (232°C), rubber sealing system might become soft.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">As presented in Fig. 8, the tool selection for the hostile formation tester in this area is opted into two configurations. Option 1 was used when the bottom hole temperature was at maximum 350°F (177°C). This number is limited at fluid sensor ability to be exposed in such hostile environments. The use of the fluid sensors provides an extensive fluid identification by using density, capacitance, and resistivity sensors. Option 2 demonstrated a more flexible option in such hostile environments. The function of the fluid sensor was substituted by bubble point testing executed by the pretest piston. The test provides compressibility and bubble point pressure, allowing determination of formation fluid.</p><div id="link-8">

In freshwater environments, highly variable Rw values can be problematic for log analysis work.
