<anchoringText id="Ancr2">The Rayoso Fm. consists of ephemeral fluvial sandstones of great lateral continuity with reservoir permeabilities varying from the low md through to darcy. The intermediate facies (lower fine and fine grained sandstones, yellow and orange facies code in Figure 2) have permeability ranging from 50-400md and contains the majority of the remaining recoverable oil. The darcy sands (medium sandstone, red in Figure 2) in most cases show connectivity at scales beyond that of the injector producer pairs, probably acting as short cuts for injection water, especially due to the high viscosity of the resident oil.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">One primary risk of injecting potentially at above parting pressure is that the fracturing will be uncontrolled and could result in the creation of a induced fractured that directly connects the injector to the producer, this amplifying the problem of shortcutting rather than increasing sweep as desired. To minimize this effect, one of the design guidelines was for the direction of principal stress to be perpendicular to the principal flow direction, so that induced fractures would preferentially travel to the adjacent injector instead of the producer. How this arrangement is expected to work in the polymer pilot area is shown in Figure 5.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr6">It was decided to keep the flowing bottomhole pressure on the producer wells in the central as low as possible at all times, this normally between 5-15 bar as determined by level data. There is the issue that this is below the bubble point of the reservoir of 35 bar and indeed the limited data available on gas production does show that the producing GOR is above solution GOR. However, since the initial reservoir pressure in the pilot area was only 38 bar, it was felt that keeping the wells producing above bubble point would choke production too much.

The irregular allocation of water in the injection tracer logs of PI-3 suggests that the impact of free gas was affecting the movement of the injection water, even after the dosing of the first tracers in March 2015. In fact the injection profile only stabilizes around the end of 2015. As the gas bearing low pressure layers were filled up, water injection moved on to the higher permeability oil containing intervals.</anchoringText>

However the minimum concentration at which we expect to see polymer by a method which involves dropping Kaolinite into the produced samples is 1-2 ppm in the laboratory although in the field the detection limit is thought to be closer to 10ppm.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr27">In the dynamic model, it is estimated that had water flooding had been allowed to continue, the water cut in the three producers would have reached nearly 95% by January 2018 while in reality the average water in the three producers has predominantly remained between 92-93% as show in Figure 27. Superimposing the expected polymer injection and waterflooding forecasts on the historical water cut data of the 3 producer wells of the pilot shows that the water cut trend until January 2018 is more likely to be following the polymer injection scenario forecast rather than the water flooding forecast.</anchoringText>

In Figure 28 we can see the forecasts for oil production by water injection and polymer injections are shown as well as the actual combined oil production data from the three producer wells in the pilot. Note: The waterflood forecast starts from February 2016 as after this date the injection rates in the pilot injectors were reduced while the polymer forecast is from August 2017.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr29">The model was also used to establish the optimum polymer dosage. What was clear from the model was that due to a very adverse mobility ratio and the high heterogeneity in the reservoir, a very high viscosity polymer would be preferred to overcome both negative traits. Unfortunately, the optimum polymer viscosity cannot be injected into the reservoir at economic rates. Hence a decision was made to inject with the highest viscosity that could achieve 100 m3/day per injector. However even with the 1.2 kg/m3 or 1.5 kg/m3 we are injecting today, we do not achieve a uniform displacement according the simulation model (Figure 29).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr30">This meant that it was now possible to consider optimization of the pilot. Utilizing the model it could be seen that the prolonged injection of water prior to polymer injection meant that the relative permeability in the highest quality facies was higher to water than was the case at initial conditions. By comparing Figures 30A and B, it is posisble to observe that that the injected water has increased the relative permeability significantly in the highest quality facies, comparatively, very little water is estimated to have entered the intermediate quality facies leading to a situation where the relative permeabilites in the highest quality facies are about 10x higher than in the intermediate quality facies.</anchoringText>

Bearing in mind that the oil has an estimated visocisty of 19cp, it will require injecting polymer with an unrelisitically high viscosity to fully overcome this bias in the transmissibility to water.
