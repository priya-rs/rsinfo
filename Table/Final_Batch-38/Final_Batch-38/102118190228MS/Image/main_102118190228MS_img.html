<p id="Ancr2">The Rayoso Fm. consists of ephemeral fluvial sandstones of great lateral continuity with reservoir permeabilities varying from the low md through to darcy. The intermediate facies (lower fine and fine grained sandstones, yellow and orange facies code in Figure 2) have permeability ranging from 50-400md and contains the majority of the remaining recoverable oil. The darcy sands (medium sandstone, red in Figure 2) in most cases show connectivity at scales beyond that of the injector producer pairs, probably acting as short cuts for injection water, especially due to the high viscosity of the resident oil.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The pilot was designed to fit in as much as possible with the existing well pattern on the field. To this end, the pilot was designed as a line drive with a line of 3 injectors lying to the east and west of a line of 3 producers. Figure 4 shows the polymer pilot design. New wells were only drilled to the Rayoso Fm. while existing wells were isolated from the underlying Agrio and Troncoso (Huitrin) Formations.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">One primary risk of injecting potentially at above parting pressure is that the fracturing will be uncontrolled and could result in the creation of a induced fractured that directly connects the injector to the producer, this amplifying the problem of shortcutting rather than increasing sweep as desired. To minimize this effect, one of the design guidelines was for the direction of principal stress to be perpendicular to the principal flow direction, so that induced fractures would preferentially travel to the adjacent injector instead of the producer. How this arrangement is expected to work in the polymer pilot area is shown in Figure 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">It was decided to keep the flowing bottomhole pressure on the producer wells in the central as low as possible at all times, this normally between 5-15 bar as determined by level data. There is the issue that this is below the bubble point of the reservoir of 35 bar and indeed the limited data available on gas production does show that the producing GOR is above solution GOR. However, since the initial reservoir pressure in the pilot area was only 38 bar, it was felt that keeping the wells producing above bubble point would choke production too much.

Also the sands lying in between these sands seem to show a clear resistivity peak but not of the same magnitude as the response in the highest quality facies.

Also to achieve the historical gross rates seen in the pilot producer wells, it was clear that the end points of the water relative permeability curve needed to be comparatively high in at least once facies. Therefore the relative permeability in the highest quality facies was modified to both have a higher end point to water and a lower Corey exponent (Figure 15B).

<p id="Ancr18">From the pilot monitoring plan, transient flow profiles carried out monthly, showed initial water injection entering the deeper depleted reservoir layers (Figure 18). The irregular allocation of water in the injection tracer logs of PI-3 suggests that the impact of free gas was affecting the movement of the injection water, even after the dosing of the first tracers in March 2015. In fact the injection profile only stabilizes around the end of 2015. As the gas bearing low pressure layers were filled up, water injection moved on to the higher permeability oil containing intervals.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr24">In figure 24, PI-3 communicates first with PP-3, this confirming that the impact of gas on the pilot had been eliminated by water injection by the time the second tracers were dosed in December 2016. To date, in January 2018 three sets of the second set of tracers have been seen in the pilot producers yet no polymer has been seen by January 2018. It is obvious that the explanation is polymer retention.</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr25">Figure 25 shows that in the dynamic model, although the simulated invasion of tracer and polymer are similar, the tracer added during polymer injection still fingers more towards the producer than the polymer, the cause of this in the dynamic model is that the low concentration fingers of polymer are assumed to be retained by the formation, this probably is also the situation in reality.</p><div id="link-25">

<p id="Ancr26">In figure 26A is the expected polymer concentration in PP-2 according to the dynamic model with the initial polymer retention estimate used in the dynamic model. In January 2018 we were expecting to see a polymer concentration of 0.05 kg/m3 as compared to the predominant injection concentration of 1.2 kg/m3. However the minimum concentration at which we expect to see polymer by a method which involves dropping Kaolinite into the produced samples is 1-2 ppm in the laboratory although in the field the detection limit is thought to be closer to 10ppm.</p><div id="link-26">

<p id="Ancr27">In the dynamic model, it is estimated that had water flooding had been allowed to continue, the water cut in the three producers would have reached nearly 95% by January 2018 while in reality the average water in the three producers has predominantly remained between 92-93% as show in Figure 27. Superimposing the expected polymer injection and waterflooding forecasts on the historical water cut data of the 3 producer wells of the pilot shows that the water cut trend until January 2018 is more likely to be following the polymer injection scenario forecast rather than the water flooding forecast.</p><div id="link-27">

<p id="Ancr28">As the model is updated, if it shows that the expected increment is less than previously expected, remedial action needs to be taken to hopefully rectify the situation. In Figure 28 we can see the forecasts for oil production by water injection and polymer injections are shown as well as the actual combined oil production data from the three producer wells in the pilot. Note: The waterflood forecast starts from February 2016 as after this date the injection rates in the pilot injectors were reduced while the polymer forecast is from August 2017.</p><div id="link-28">

<p id="Ancr29">The model was also used to establish the optimum polymer dosage. What was clear from the model was that due to a very adverse mobility ratio and the high heterogeneity in the reservoir, a very high viscosity polymer would be preferred to overcome both negative traits. Unfortunately, the optimum polymer viscosity cannot be injected into the reservoir at economic rates. Hence a decision was made to inject with the highest viscosity that could achieve 100 m3/day per injector. However even with the 1.2 kg/m3 or 1.5 kg/m3 we are injecting today, we do not achieve a uniform displacement according the simulation model (Figure 29).</p><div id="link-29">

<p id="Ancr30">This meant that it was now possible to consider optimization of the pilot. Utilizing the model it could be seen that the prolonged injection of water prior to polymer injection meant that the relative permeability in the highest quality facies was higher to water than was the case at initial conditions. By comparing Figures 30A and B, it is posisble to observe that that the injected water has increased the relative permeability significantly in the highest quality facies, comparatively, very little water is estimated to have entered the intermediate quality facies leading to a situation where the relative permeabilites in the highest quality facies are about 10x higher than in the intermediate quality facies.</p><div id="link-30">

<p id="Ancr31">The highest quality facies have water transmissibility about 50-200 times greater than that expected in the intermediate facies (Figure 31). Bearing in mind that the oil has an estimated visocisty of 19cp, it will require injecting polymer with an unrelisitically high viscosity to fully overcome this bias in the transmissibility to water. Consequently the simulation model is being used to estimate what combination(s) of injection rate and injected polymer viscosity offer the best return</p><div id="link-31">
