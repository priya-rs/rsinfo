<p id="Ancr2">Current workflows for selecting well landing depth are centered around selecting a few landing points in the vertical wellbore (pilot) driven by RQ and then evaluating the fracture geometries using a hydraulic fracture model to assess the well connectivity and pinchout and height of the fractures. The fracture geometries having no pinchouts or flow barriers and no uncontrolled height growth are considered favorable landing points. The same landing point/rock layer is typically followed for the horizontal well trajectory profile to plan the lateral drilling. Fig. 1 shows a typical workflow for landing point study.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The recovery factors remain in the single digits for most of the operators. Fig. 2 shows the location of Permian basin and a cross section showing the Delaware basin, central basin platform, Midland basin, and eastern shelf. The Wolfcamp, Spraberry, and Bone Spring are the most prolific formations in the basin. Parent-child well interaction has recently received a lot of discussion in literature for the Wolfcamp owing to multiple producing benches in the reservoir. These producing benches are commonly classified in four different layers, from top to bottom (Mohan 2013): Wolfcamp A, Wolfcamp B, Wolfcamp C, and Wolfcamp D. Characteristics of the layers are as follows:</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">Pseudo 3D models (Fig. 8) are primarily cell-based models and fracture propagation and fluid flow are computed on a horizontal axis. These models solve the transport in 1D and the vertical height growth is determined by equilibrium and volume balance. The concept is derived from the legacy PKN model having a constant pressure in each cell and concatenating the fracture geometry computed in these cells. The model is a good engineering approximation for routine/quick design and evaluation, especially in conventional sandstone reservoirs, but fails under a more complex and laminated stress environment such as shales.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">The fracture width is based on 3D elasticity; fluid and proppant flow during the fracture propagation are fully 2D (within fracture plane). The model couples the fluid flow equation described by a 2D mesh of cells, typically a moving triangular mesh oriented in a (vertical) plane, as shown in Fig. 9. Most importantly, the geomechanical properties and stress parameter variations are treated more accurately across the layers, which defines the fracture shape and height more precisely.</p><div id="link-9">

In this study, we have defined three discrete natural fracture (DFN) sets, namely dense, medium, and rare to determine the impact of the natural fractures on landing wellbore. As the name suggests, the density (spacing) of fractures is the only variable changing between these fracture networks. Length and orientation of the fractures has been held constant among the fracture sets. Figs. 17-19 show the hydraulic fracture geometries created using the dense, medium, and rare natural fracture networks, respectively.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr21">Fig. 20 compares the hydraulic fracture surface area, fracture lengths, and fluid efficiency for each case on a relative comparison to the dense DFN case. The dense natural fracture case has the shortest fracture length in the direction of maximum stress but the greatest length in the direction of minimum stress due to development of hydraulic fracture complexity. This case also has the highest fracture surface area and therefore the highest efficiency. For the rare fracture network, the fracture length is the greatest and fracture surface area the least, thereby offering the lowest efficiency.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr22">Fig. 21 shows the production comparison for the hydraulic fracture network created in the three cases. It is observed that the rare natural fracture case shows the highest production whereas the dense natural fracture case shows the least production. Although the dense natural fractures develop the largest surface area, not all of the area can be filled with proppant. High-viscosity slickwater can penetrate the natural fractures and develop a complex fracture network, but the proppant may not be able to enter the entire hydraulic length due to its larger size. The case of rare natural fractures has the longest fracture length, which extends far into the reservoir and records the highest production.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr23">If completion is given a priority with the hope that fractures can contact the good RQ rock, then there could be issues in maintaining the connectivity of fractures with the good rock and the well would fail. If RQ is given a higher preference, then there could be nonuniform initiation of fractures along the wellbore, which will not drain the reservoir uniformly. The ideal situation is to land the well in a sweet spot that has good RQ and CQ and steer the well to stay in the zone of interest. Modern technologies have made it possible to land and steer the well in any desired trajectory. Lane and Chokshi (2014) presented normalized wellbore trajectories from different basins that show that each basin has a dominant well profile (Fig. 22).</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr36">Due to small simulation timesteps in the wellbore hydraulic model, the integrated model was run by 20 short simulation periods instead of 5 years to reduce the run time. Fig. 35 shows the total liquid production rates at wellhead for wells with different trajectories. We can see that the hold-toe-down trajectory has a higher production rate in the early period but has the lowest production rate in the late period. For all well trajectories, sooner or later, unstable production behavior, such as hydrodynamic slugging, is observed. The toe-up well and hold-toe-up well tend to experience slugging issues earlier than the others.</p><div id="link-35">

<p id="Ancr37">Among the five well trajectories, the horizontal well produces the most cumulative liquid volume, as shown in Fig. 36. This result from the wellbore hydraulic model is consistent with the standalone reservoir simulation result. The toe-down and hold-toe-down wells are underperforming compared to others. This is due to liquid accumulation near the toe, which impairs the production from stages close to the toe.</p><div id="link-36">

<p id="Ancr38">There exists a secure operating envelope (SOE) in which the flowback operation should be performed to mitigate the detrimental effects of high drawdown. If the operation is carried out outside of the safe margin, then there is potential to damage the proppant pack or cause proppant flowback. Construction of the SOE (discussed in detail by Potapenko et al. 2017) requires information on geomechanics, well tubular, perforations, and proppant. Fig. 37 illustrates the concept of and SOE that can be used during flowback operations to safely flow back the well and mitigate problems related to fracture damage and formation damage.</p><div id="link-37">

<p id="Ancr39">Well shut-in simulations were performed using the wellbore hydraulic models following the 5-year production conditions. A well restart scenario was also included to see if any well trajectory would lead to a restart failure. Fig. 38 shows the liquid holdup distribution in the wellbore after shutting down the wells for 1 day. It shows there are liquid slugs in the lateral sections of the toe-down, hold-toe-down, and oscillating trajectories. These liquid slugs will arrive at the surface separator and will be a challenge to handle after the well is restarted. Table 1 shows the total liquid volume in the wellbore after 1 day of shutting in.</p><div id="link-38">
