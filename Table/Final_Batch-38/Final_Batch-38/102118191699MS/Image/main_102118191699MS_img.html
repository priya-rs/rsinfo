<p id="Ancr8">The hypothetical Mermaid field (Figure 1) is an oil field located in the deep-water Gulf of Mexico. Production commenced in January 2000. As of January 2010, the field was under secondary recovery and staged field developments. The objective of the study was to perform a probabilistic DoE-based history matching to better understand the reservoir properties and evaluate the uncertainty of the production forecast. The findings would help determine the value-adding development strategy in the future.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">We used the One-Variable-at-A-Time (OVAT) design to create tornado plots (see Figure 2). Note that tornado plot has many limitations. It has a poor coverage of the uncertainty space, its analysis is anchored in mid-values, and it cannot test the interaction between input variables. We only used it as a first-blush sensitivity analysis to gain a quick understanding of the behavior of each input variable. In addition, we used it to confirm that no false signal was picked up from the dummy variable, which is expected if the experimental design is executed correctly.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr10">All the simulations were finished successfully. The simulated production curves were plotted and compared with the historical data (see Figure 3). There are no apparent outliers and the distribution of the curves does not show any anomaly (e.g., too wide, too narrow, or too skewed, or multi-modal). The historical production curves are contained within the spread of the simulated curves, and the shape of the simulated and historical curves are similar. If any of the above two conditions are not satisfied, obtaining a history-matched solution is unlikely.</p><div id="link-3">

Small influence of DUMMY was observed, and was not labeled as heavy hitter for any response variable.

<p id="Ancr12">In this study, a Latin hypercube design of 500 runs was used as the experimental design for proxy building. Thirty percent of the runs were selected randomly for blind testing, and the remaining 70% were used for proxy training. Alternatively, we could use 10-fold cross validation for blind testing (James et al., 2013). Scatter plots (see Figure 5) were reviewed to confirm that the Latin hypercube design sampled the uncertainty space evenly without apparent patterns and clusters. The scatter plots also confirmed that the blind-test runs were selected randomly.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr13">In this study, four types of proxies were chosen for each eHM metric: linear-interaction (bilinear), full-quadratic, thin-plate spline, and neural network proxies. The blind-test results of all four proxies were compared for each eHM metric. The root-mean-squared errors (RMSE) and the correlation coefficients (R) between the proxy-estimated response values and the actual response values were computed. The scatter plots with 45° line and the residual plots were also reviewed (see Figure 6(a) and (b)).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr20">With the presence of model error, even if a suite of models with eHM = 0 can still be found for each eHM metric, they may not intersect, as illustrated in Figure 13(a) and (b). Indeed, experience suggests that it is easier to history-match one metric but much harder to match all metrics simultaneously. Even if they do intersect, there is no guarantee that the actual reservoir model is contained in the intersection. Therefore, a threshold eHM value, denoted by T, should be defined for each eHM metric, as shown in Figure 13(a). A model whose eHM is ≤T should be accepted for this eHM metric. Each eHM metric should have its own T. If a model is accepted for all the metrics, it becomes a member of the final ensemble of history-matched models, as depicted in Figure 13(c). Essentially, the filtering criterion is relaxed from eHM = 0 to eHM≤T as a compromise to the inherent and inevitable limitation of the reservoir model.</p><div id="link-13">

The solid blue curve indicates the proxy response of eHM from Monte-Carlo simulation, and dashed red curves represent the confidence interval (δ) due to data-measurement and proxy errors. The red or green shaded regions are where the entire range of the confidence interval is above or below the T value, respectively.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr22">The solution is to also accept the middle region. This amounts to raising the T value to T* by the confidence interval (δ), which is a function of the data-measurement error (ε) and the proxy error (ξ). Namely, T*=T+δ. A Monte-Carlo sample whose eHM is ≤T* should be accepted for this eHM metric, as illustrated in Figure 15. Every eHM metric has its own T*, T, ε, ξ, and δ. If a Monte-Carlo sample is accepted for all the eHM metrics, it becomes a candidate of history-matched model. Since all the candidates are evaluated by proxies, they should be verified by actual simulations to become the final ensemble of history-matched models. This is depicted in the right panel of Figure 15.</p><div id="link-15">
