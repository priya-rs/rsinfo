<p id="Ancr9">B6 LL 370 reservoir is located in the Tia Juana Lago field with a length of 90 km. The reservoir is located 20 km offshore northeast of Lake Maracaibo in Zulia state. It is limited to the northeast and south by normal faults with northwest-southeast direction and dip to the northeast. West-northwest the reservoir is truncated by the Eocene unconformity, which has a southward dip of 40° approximately and southeast by the oil-water contact5, 6. Fig. 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr13">B6 LL 370 reservoir started production in 1939, with the drilling of the LL-370 well and has a total of 318 wells. The main mechanisms of production were gravity segregation and solution gas as primary and gas and water injection, as secondary5, 6. The PNOGO worked 33 wells in the field generating 40.43 MMscfd, which represents 60,57% of the total production of the project and further oil production. Fig. 5 shows the production behavior of B6 LL 370 reservoir.</p><div id="link-5">
