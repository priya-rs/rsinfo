<p id="Ancr1">The project started with a review and finalization of the operator’s LWD objectives. This, along with the well design (Figure 1), is the main driver of BHA tools and components. After suitable LWD tools had been identified, a draft BHA was designed for performing HEWD and RHE in a single run. Suitable offset wells were identified based on seismic data and well correlation. Information from select offset wells provided rock strength data and past drilling records, which are essential input for the advanced BHA dynamic modeling.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Crucial inputs for the DDM include formation data—lithologies and their respective unconfined com-pressive strength (UCS). This information heavily impacts the simulation results and is usually sourced from rock strength analysis (RSA) of known offset wells in the vicinity of the subject well. With the subject well having only a few nearby offsets, there were some uncertainties regarding which wells would give a suitable geological correlation (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Initial modeling began with a preliminary analysis of multiple representative BHA combinations without consideration of the LWD tool placement. The purpose was to study the effect of different near-bit stabilizer sizes (16 in, 16½ in, 16¾ in, and 17 in) on the dynamics of the base BHA and the cutting structure interaction. Results from these simulations showed severe axial and lateral vibrations along with high stick/slip levels with all the stabilizer sizes modeled (Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The best outcome came through a configuration that had a 157⁄8-in near-bit stabilizer coupled with a 16¾-in stabilizer in a BHA with complete LWD/MWD tools, that was put in simulation to compare two five-bladed PDC bits (a directional matrix bit against a steel PDC bit), and two potential underreamer cutter blocks (Figure 4). At this step, the final stage of the DDM process also took place in which the cutting structure selection was evaluated in line with the parameter sensitivity analysis.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Based on the results from this analysis, possible solutions were identified despite still facing some stick/slip issues. The DDM predicted that the matrix directional PDC bit would perform better, and out of the two applicable underreamer cutter blocks, there was a clear recommendable combination (Bit 2, Reamer 2). There were no predicted issues with vibrations or stick/slip for this bit-reamer-BHA combination in HEWD Mode, allowing a wide operating parameter window (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">There were minor lateral vibration issues identified for the bit-reamer-BHA combination in RHE mode when a WOB of 6,000 lbf or above was applied (Figure 6). However, considering the much shorter drilling interval of the RHE mode (compared with the HEWD mode), the options and parameters available were excellent provided the WOB was kept low. Through this process, the best bit, stabilizer size and placement, and underreamer cutter block combination was identified, and the DDM showed stable drilling characteristics and a wide sweet spot of usable parameter window (Bit 2, Reamer 2).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">Shown in Figure 7 are the simulation results for the bit and reamer combination ran in hole (Bit 1, Reamer 2) in both HEWD (top) and RHE (bottom). Plots on the left show lateral vibrations (Gs) across a given set of rpm and WOB at the bit, underreamers, and all the different LWD tools. The charts on the right show the stick/slip levels at the bit through multiple sets of parameters. The thresholds are shown in green (good), orange (marginal), and red (severe). The vibration levels in RHE mode are generally always higher because only one reamer cutting structure is engaging the formation without the bit piloting the string.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">With the optimized BHA, drilling began with a small amount of stick/slip but once the recommended parameters were observed (kept WOB below 6,000 lbf), drilling performance improved, and the field results closely matched the simulations. Drilling was smooth as a result of minimal vibrations and stick/slip (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">The analysis for this section began with an LWD and BHA configuration very similar to that of the previous hole section. A selection of two steel bits (five-bladed and six-bladed) and two types of underreamer cutter blocks were simulated through the three selected rock scenarios. Initial results showed severe high lateral vibrations with borderline axial vibrations and stick/slip levels in both HEWD and RHE modes (Figure 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">Despite the dissatisfactory vibration and stick/slip levels, the underreamer cutter block had to be decided due to regional availability. Modifications to the BHA would be necessary to improve the drilling performance. Hence, it was decided to model another PDC bit along with tweaks to the BHA to determine if a more stable combination could be found. Figure 11 shows examples of BHA optimization options considered to be able to address the vibration and stick/slip issues. These examples involve the addition of a stabilizer or drill collar to reposition the stabilization points in the BHA.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">The most promising resulting analysis for this section involved the comparison between two six-bladed 16-mm cutter PDC bits (steel bit with single-row cutters and matrix bit with dual-row cutters), the two finalized underreamer cutter blocks, and two BHA configurations that had the near bit stabilizer placement as the only difference (Figure 12). Again, these tools were simulated through three different rock scenarios and through both HEWD and RHE drilling modes.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">Looking at the results of this analysis, it was found that by placing the string stabilizer between the bit and the underreamer (BHA2), significant reductions in vibrations could be achieved in both HEWD (Figure 13) and RHE modes (Figure 14) without significantly compromising stick/slip and stresses. This is consistent with a few similar modeling studies on other projects, which have shown that having a string stabilizer between the bit and underreamer (BHA2) could offer improved drilling stability when compared with having the stabilizer above the underreamer (BHA1).</p><div id="link-13">

Lateral vibration is shown on the left while stick/slip levels are shown on the right. Thresholds are again shown in green (good), orange (marginal), and red (severe). Here it is seen that vibration levels had two highs in HEWD mode, at 160 rpm and 10,000 –15,000 lbf, while stick/slip levels were acceptable. In RHE mode, vibration wasn’t a major concern, but stick/slip levels were above severe.</p><div id="link-15">
