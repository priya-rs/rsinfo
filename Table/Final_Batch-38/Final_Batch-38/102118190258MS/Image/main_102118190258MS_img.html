<p id="Ancr3">Finally, the local grid radial refinement near the X45 producer's wellbore (Fig. 1 Red Icon well) was built in W field's full-field corner grid system numerical model (15 injectors &amp; 36 producers) by using the local grid radial refinement method above. And the target injectors and producers' production performance had been historically matched by adjusting completion connection factor and grid transmissibility, in order to determine the plugging degree of plugging radius near wells X45.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">At present, the plugging problem of some oil wells in W oilfield has resulted in the obvious drop of liquid production, such as X45 well (Fig. 2). It is urgent to study the blocking mechanism and influence law of the polymer flooding oilfield, to provide support for the plugging removal and acidification measures, and to ensure the effect of the polymer flooding.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Through simulation with the detailed description of reservoir and polymer properties, the impacts of key parameters (injection time, polymer concentration, injected volume, relative permeability cures, etc) affecting the production rate of producers in different stages of polymer flooding were analyzed (Table 1,Fig. 4). On this basis, the numerical simulation of water flooding and polymer flooding is carried out (Eclipse technical manual 2017). Water flooding was carried out by 60% water cut, then polymer injection was conducted by 0.3 PV, finally the following water flooding was used till water cut 98%.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr14">Firstly, the grid transmissibility in different scope near to the producers was modified to simulate the different pollution radius (0.1, 1.2, 3, 5 m). It could be seen that with the increase of pollution radius, well fluid volume decline rate increased, resulting longer low liquid level duration (Fig. 12).</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr16">The production dynamics of X45 well was given in Fig.2, in which the obvious drop of liquid volume appeared in the middle of 2011 and early 2014. To simulate the influence of plugging with different scope and degree, the Transmissibility in near wellbore grid around X45 was set in various radius (3 meters, 5 meters, 15 meters) of (MULTX / MULTY / MULTZ in X/Y/Z direction). The history match results of oil and liquid production rate were given in Fig 14, from which we could see that: the better matching result was obtained when the pollution radius was set to 5 m.</p><div id="link-14">
