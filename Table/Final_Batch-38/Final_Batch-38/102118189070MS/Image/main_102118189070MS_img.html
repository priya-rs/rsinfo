<p id="Ancr2">The Central North Sea is a Jurassic rift basin and one of Europe's most important oil and gas basins. The principal areas of activity in the basin are the Central Graben with extensions into the Moray Firth and the Viking Graben (see Figure 1). Exploration targets are mainly the sandstone reservoirs in the Upper Jurassic Fulmar and Palaeocene Forties formations as well as the chalk reservoirs of the Danian Ekofisk Formation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The complex geological history of the basin as detailed in Underhill and Partington (1993) and Primio and Neumann (2008) is dominated by extensional tectonics, thermal doming, rifting and subsidence. As shown in Figure 2, the known stratigraphy comprises several rock types that are dominated by mudstones, chalk and sandstones of a range of ages from the pre-Permian to Recent.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The results of overpressure estimation using the two chosen methods (Eaton, 1975; Yang and Aplin, 2004) in the identified mudstone intervals and their relationship with measured data and drilling mud weights in each of the wells are shown in Figure 4. For each of the wells discussed, the NCT and VES compaction models that are representative of the location of the wells in the basin as described in Nwozor (2016) were respectively applied.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Fisher Bank Basin and mid Graben as the main areas of challenge. While it is often suggested that adjusting Eaton exponents to higher values will yield a match between log-based estimates and the observed overpressure in areas of suspected multiple overpressure mechanisms, however, the geological validity of changing the Eaton exponent in the context of pore pressure prediction and understanding the causes of overpressure is still diffuse. Thus, as subsequently shown in Figure 5, the results of changing the Eaton exponent to fit local observations indicate that improved fits could always be achieved, but a wide range of Eaton exponents that exceed 4.0 in many cases are required in the Central North Sea (see Table 1).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">It is expected that higher Eaton exponents would correlate with higher overpressures so that a predictive strategy will be achieved. However, this is not the case. The lack of correlation between modified Eaton exponents and reservoir overpressures is made more obvious on a cross-plot of both quantities (Figure 6). Wells in the plot have been coloured according to their locations in the graben. Purple colour denotes wells in the West Central Shelf, green and blue for those in the northern and southern West Central Graben while the Fisher Bank and Mid Graben wells are coloured red.</p><div id="link-6">

<figcaption><b>Figure 6 </b> Comparing modified Eaton exponents with amounts of overpressure shows no clear pattern of data distribution. An exponent of 2.5 fits data only in the West Central Shelf wells (purple coloured data) where overpressure is typically low and expected to be caused by disequilibrium compaction. Across the rest of the study area, the wells bear no identical Eaton exponent.</figcaption>
