<p id="Ancr11">In such conditions, integration of material balance to volumetric calculations constraint uncertainty in geological and geophysical data. Typically, equivalent volumetric STOIIP and dynamic STOIIP indicates limited uncertainty in volumetric calculations. In the present study a systematic approach of quality check and sensitivity analysis for STOIIP calculations is presented to evaluate volumetric reserve calculations and explore for possible reservoir extension. Fig. 1 presents a flow chart for volumetric STOIIP validation through dynamic modeling of multi-layered heterogeneous reservoirs while details of ach step are independently presented.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr12">Gas measurements are influential for dynamic STOIIP calculations and dramatically affect these calculations through reservoir life. In some cases where there are more than one PVT samples, gas oil ratio typically set equal to Rsoi at the undersaturated production period. If gas measurements are inaccurate, PVT data can be used to correct gas production data, especially in depletion drive reservoirs where gas greatly affect the dynamic STOIIP calculations. Two cases can be encountered for gas measurements; underestimation or overestimation (Fig. 2). For underestimated Gas oil ratio, a correction factor can be approximated according to Eq. 6 and the corrected GOR is calculated using Eq. 7.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr13">On observing Fig. 3, Fault#4 is interpreted geologically as a fault cut at the well-A1, but such interpretation is not supported by seismic data due to the poor quality. Consequently, the attitude of Fault#4 is probably inaccurate and the proper orientation should lean towards the north direction so that the increase in dynamic STOIIP could be accommodated and amazingly follow the trend of the main clysmic fault (Fig. 11). Extending the Nezzazat reservoir to the north encourage to think of drilling a new well to increase the recoverable reserves of the field and achieve a new ultimate recovery.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr14">This interval represents a high permeability zone (300 mD) encountered within the entire reservoir and correspond to Wata formation. Further, numerous reservoir intervals showed intermediate pressure (~3500 psi) that correspond to the upper Mattula interval with intermediate permeability (200mD). High pressure reservoir intervals (3900-4500 psi) are usually corresponding to the middle and lower Mattula with relatively low permeability (4-80 mD). Fig. 5 presents layer contribution (calculated from recorded mobility data) to total production ratio that follow the permeability trends of individual hydraulic flow units.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr15">Lateral extension of the seven HFU has been confirmed, but lateral heterogeneity within each unit remained a challenge. Besides sand thinning from north to south, porosity showed notable variations in 14 well data, including offset wells (Fig. 6). Therefore, 0D modeling (e.g. MBAL) is not recommended to simulate such cases of reservoir lateral and vertical heterogeneity and multi layered modeling is the only way to present such reservoir conditions.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr16">Reservoir characterization is initialized via well log interpretation and zonation of similar facies across Nezzazat group. Such zonation identified seven reservoir intervals separated by shale barriers that could be traced and correlated through the studied field (Fig. 7). The overall zonation is confirmed by pressure depletion in each zone observed in a well (A6A) drilled 7 years after drilling the first exploratory well (A1)(Fig. 4). In addition, subsequent water injection through well (A6A) showed excellent pressure support to the producing zones in well (A1) (Fig. C2). The identified reservoir units are further investigated using available RFT data through plotting the recorded pressure points of RFT data versus depth (Fig. 4) to identify zonation trends.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr17">Fluid properties and reservoir conditions have been distributed through the static model and dynamic calculations have been accomplished using Nexus 5000.4.10 (Landmark, 2014). The present dynamic model comprises 50*50*94 cell of dimensions (L: 250, W: 250, H: 10 ft.) that simulate flow within seven reservoir units separated by barriers (Fig. 8). Injection in the field adopted dump flooding technique that is simulated with an injection well with constant bottom hole pressure. To avoid numerical model dispersion, local grid refinement is utilized around injector well. The steps applied for building the dynamic model are closely similar to those presented by (Carlson, 2003).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr18">In such circumstance, further permeability enhancement using PLT data are usually needed (Mohamed, 2014). PLT contribution and RFT measurements of reservoir intervals are used as a key parameter of history match. History match is achieved utilizing pore volume multipliers that calculate a dynamic STOIIP capable of providing the measured PLT and RFT data. Numerous pore volume multipliers are attempted until the calculated flow and pressure data match PLT and RFT measurements. Fig. 9 shows the history match achieved for every layer from the aforementioned seven layers using PLT response.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr23">The developed fault block communication with adjacent blocks possibility increases the uncertainty in volumetric STOIIP calculations (Lill-Tove W. S., 2002). Relaying only on volumetric STOIIP in complicated structural basins, especially with poor seismic data, could lead to a major uncertainty in structure model, whether for field lateral extension or other blocks juxtaposition (J.S. van Wyk, et. el, 2005). This is the typical conditions prevailing the Gulf of Suez concessions where the thick salt section of South Gharib formation ± 1000 ft.

<p id="Ancr24">In some areas where thick salt sections exist, e.g. Gulf of Suez, seismic imaging is so difficult due to strong acoustic impedance and velocity contrasts at the sediment-evaporites interface (Fig. D2, Appendix "D"). In such situations the structure mapping quality is highly governed by the available wells data and in early exploration phases, it is impossible to reliably predict the structure extension and even fault identification is not an easy target. Thus, volumetric STOIIP calculations based on maps derived from poor seismic quality with low well density have enormous uncertainty and cannot be adopted for field development plans.</p><div id="link-14">

In a similar pattern, GOR starts a rapid increase with the commence of production till water injection started. Generally, a little or even no water is produced through the field primary recovery production reflecting a weak bottom aquifer and solution gas drive mechanism. Water production (10-15%) indicating an early breakthrough is observed in 2014 that associate low dump effect induced by incompatible water and formation of scale damage within the injection well (Fig. E1, Appendix "E").</p><div id="link-15">
