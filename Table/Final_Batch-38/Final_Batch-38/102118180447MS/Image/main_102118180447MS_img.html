<p id="Ancr8">Thermal (steam) enhanced oil recovery (TEOR) has had wide spread and expanded commercial success in California since the 1960s (Hong, 1994). California’s heavy oil fields were deposited in five sedimentary basins located in the southern half of the state as shown in Figure 2. Although discovery and initial primary production was more than 100 years ago, most of the oil remains left behind as contingent resources because it moves very slowly when cold.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">By transferring heat into the cold oil in the oil zones, TEOR greatly reduces oil viscosity, increasing flow and commercializing large fractions of remaining oil in place as reserves, as shown in Figure 3. With a contingent resource of nearly 60 billion barrels of heavy oil remaining in place, California TEOR reserves are near 4 billion barrels as shown in Figure 4 (DOE, 1996).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr11">Higher CI crudes have the potential to generate more LCFS deficits when refined in California, which may require more biofuel blending and other petroleum fuel demand destruction. Per the regulation, if the average CI of crude run by California refiners rises above the average CI of crudes in the 2010 baseline slate, higher-CI crude oils will result in higher compliance costs, and so be penalized with lower prices. The price penalties will directly reduce reserve values of all categories shown in Figure 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">The steam-oil ratio (SOR) is the ratio of injected steam divided by oil produced. As shown in Figure 6, SOR is considered on a pattern by pattern basis. The SOR value is critical to reserve commercialization in heavy oil resources, as SOR determines the major component of operating cost for thermal EOR (TEOR) projects, the cost of natural gas as fuel to create steam. SOR depends on geology, project design, and ongoing operational management of injected steam.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr13">TEOR projects are developed over time on a phased basis. Typical early phases include the construction of central facilities including steam generation equipment, fluid processing tanks and vessels. Early phases also include drilling, completing, and connecting initial steamflood patterns. After some time, steam injection rates are reduced in the initial patterns, and additional wells are drilled and connected to the central facilities. This process is repeated and may include vertical expansion operations whereby perforations are added to existing wells to begin injection and/or production from “behind pipe” oil zones. Schematically, the inventory of undeveloped reserves is shown in Figure 7.</p><div id="link-7">

Decisions to be made include (1) ratio of solar steam to natural gas-fired steam (0%, 15%, or 50%) and (2) for solar steam, whether or not to retain or transfer LCFS credits. This approach yields five cases to be compared for each project SOR.</p><div id="link-15">
