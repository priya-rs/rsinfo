<p id="Ancr3">Jake field, situated in the town of al-Fula in South Kordofan State of Sudan, was discovered in July, 2006 by the exploration well Jake South-1, which intersected 227 ft of oil-bearing Bentiu reservoir and 149 ft of gas-bearing Abu Gabra reservoir. Bentiu and Abu Gabra sandstones belong to the Cretaceous geological period. Structurally, as shown in Fig.1 and 2, Bentiu pool, the major oil reservoir, in Jake field is a complex faulted anticline with hydrocarbons trapped. The maximum dipping angle is about 18 degrees to the northwest.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">A drill stem test was undertaken over the pay interval in Abu Gabra formation and a gas-condensate reservoir was identified. The tested interval of well Jake South-4 was perforated with 5 shots/ft, and exploited 4.85 MMscf/d of natural gas and 183 bbl/d of 63° API condensate on a 28/64"choke with a flowing tubing pressure of 1,200 psig, resulted in a calculated absolute open flow potential (AOFP) of 10.487 MMscf/d. Original reservoir pressure and reservoir temperature were 3,527 psia and 216?, i.e., initial pressure gradient was 0.418 psi/ft, thus, the gas-condensate reservoir was classified as normally pressured. Composition analysis of a representative gas sample obtained in the course of extended flow test indicated that it contained 81 mole% methane, and 19 mole % C2 plus. The phase diagram from one pressure-volume-temperature (PVT) sample was assumed to represent the gas-condensate behavior, indicating dew point pressure of 1,050 psia, as depicated in Fig.3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">During the process of natural gas dissolved in crude oil, relatively stabilized foamy oil and slow gas liberation process were observed. As shown in Fig.4, in the course of simulated gas injection process of Bentiu crude oil from Well Jake South-1, after injection pressure dropped to zero, plenty of bubbles in crude oil sustained for over ten minutes.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The surface facilities called for some modification. As shown in Fig.5, the Christmas tree for huff and puff process were rated for 5,000 psi to accommodate high-pressure gas and requested an access via one manifold in order to permit high-pressure gas to go into the annulus, reservoir-performance-monitoring called for installation of one gas flow meter in the manifold for flow rate measurement. Single-stage, three-phase separation was used throughout the field.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">As shown in Fig.6, 7, and 8, Jake field came on stream in July 2010. At the early production stage, although electrical power project had not completed, Wells Jake South -4 and 1 tested by progressing cavity pump, turned out to be flowing naturally from the annulus in puff processes, thanks to sufficient high-pressure gas-condensate injected into the oil pools within 20 days prior to start-up of the field. When the wells ceased production, a new cycle of huff process re-started. The cyclic process can be repeated several times, but the oil recovery efficiency reduced with the number of cycles. At this development phase, huff and puff processes were dominant production practice, along with most of oil production. Field production peaked at 30,000 BOPD in July, 2011.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr11">As shown in Fig.9, this static pressure gradient curve was from Well Jake South-13, an updip well. This curve exhibits two distinct segments, one segment representing gas phase and another segment representing liquid phase with pressure gradient of 0.293 psi/ft. Static pressure gradients from downdip wells, such as Jake South-11, 20 and 27 varied from 0.317 to 0.356 psi/ft, this phenomenon suggested that more injected gas existed at the structural crest region under gravity segregation, resulting in oil viscosity reduction, which allowed the crude to flow more easily toward the producers.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">Single well model was constructed with nodal-analysis software to predict bottom-hole pressure and optimize production parameters. The principal inputs for the model were the tubing configuration and hydrocarbon properties. The nodal analysis tool was applied to calculate the stabilized rate at the operating point. For instance, Well Jake South-4 produced oil from the annulus between the tubing and the casing during puff process. If we apply nodal analysis software and input wellhead pressures, fluid properties, physical sizes of tubing and casing, vertical multiphase flow correlation, then we can obtain stabilized flow rate of 13,000 STB/d at operating point, as shown in Fig.10.</p><div id="link-10">
