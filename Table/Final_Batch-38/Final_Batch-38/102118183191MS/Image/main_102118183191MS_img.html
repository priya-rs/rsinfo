<p id="Ancr1">We illustrate our approach for CO2 flooding using a 2D heterogeneous cross section (Fig. 1). The cross section (200 × 1 × 180 grid) has a fixed porosity of 0.10 and spatially heterogeneous permeability. A producer and an injector with 45 ICVs each have been completed on either sides of the cross section. The large number of ICVs, though off from a practical scenario, is simply used to demonstrate the stability of the workflow under large number of constraints.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The base case considers reactive control where production/injection ICV rate equals to 150 RB/D. The production ICVs are shut when their GOR exceeds 100 Mscf/STB. The combined effects of heterogeneity, viscous fingering and gravity segregation lead to preferential CO2 movement towards the top production ICVs in the base case (Fig. 2a). This results in early CO2 breakthrough and reduced sweep efficiency.</p><div id="link-2">

For norm weight of 0, the injection rate is sufficiently low so that the resulting sweep is dominated by the effects of gravitational segregation, thereby creating gravity tongue.

Fig. 18 shows that the optimal rates corresponding to scenario 2 resulted in higher oil recovery and higher injection efficiency over scenario 1. The results clearly demonstrate the ability of our approach to address geologic uncertainty during field-scale flood optimization.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr19">The base case considers alternate injection of water and CO2 for 4 months and 2 months respectively under reactive control described earlier. This results in WAG ratio (volume water/volume CO2 at reservoir condition) of 2:1 during each cycle (Fig. 19a). The optimal production/injection rates for maximizing sweep efficiency were obtained using norm weight of 0. The average WAG ratio for 20 years of production for sweep efficiency maximization is close to that for the base case. However, as shown in Fig. 19b, the WAG ratio for each cycle varies from 1.2 RB/RB to 3.9 RB/RB.</p><div id="link-19">
