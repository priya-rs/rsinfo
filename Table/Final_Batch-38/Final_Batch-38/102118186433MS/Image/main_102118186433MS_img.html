<p id="Ancr1">There are eighteen reservoir sands in total divided into four intervals classified as Pacoota 1 (P1), Pacoota 2 (P2), Pacoota 3 (P3), and Pacoota 4 (P4). P1, which has fluvial dominated coastal deposits in the form of distributaries mouth bars, is the main gas production reservoir. P3, which is braided from fluvial channels of delta front and mouth bars, is the main oil-producing reservoir with small gas production from a crested well (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Meanwhile, although the fault structure could be defined from seismic interpretation, the poor resolution in 2D seismic has given further uncertainty. In fact, the seismic resolution over the Eastern region was not adequate to determine the sealing capacity of small structure faults, in particular thrust fault B (Baleanu 2012). Similarly, over the West, even though a reprocessed seismic resolution has disclosed a splinter of small faults that obliquely disturb the Southwestern Flank (Figure 2), the density of splinter faults and the seal capacity due to those splinter faults provides certainty.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">While original fluid samples in P3 formation consistently show similarity in composition and properties (Figure 3), only six samples were ever gathered and there were confined within the East to Northeast region of thrust fault B. Due to the small number of samples collected in such a confined area, it is uncertain that uniform fluid properties would occur across thrust faults left alone the whole field. Furthermore, even if the same fluid fingerprint is confirmed across the field, additional clarification is necessary because uniform fluid properties over a large region does not guaranty a single homogeneous compartment (Smalley, 2010).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Due to the lack of clarity from the small number of fluid samples, a pressure gradient analysis was carried out. This method introduced the idea of the regional interconnection amongst compartments. From the graph (Figure 4), the gas-oil contact level appeared consistent to all Pacoota sands (-2129 feets subsea),which confirmed the original intercommunication between the gas cap regions across the Pacoota formation. Meanwhile, a visible difference of 180 psi between East-Nose and other areas has proven the significant impact of thrush fault B on sealing the East-Nose region.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Similarly, pressure in Southwest Flank and Northwest Flank was observed four times higher than the East Flank and East-Nose. However, the extent of compartment at Southwest Flank was never fully understood because of the limited number of well placement, which is critical to verify the pressure gradient (Baleanu, 2012). Mereenie field was finally divided into five regions of interest, which are North Flank, South Flank, East-Nose, North-West Flank and South-West Flank (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">However, the complexity of production conditions in terms of multi-zones perforation, injection period and unsteady injection rate made Mereenie a unique field. A more systematic approach to identify, quantify and verify each compartment and the connectivity between them was necessary. This framework consisted of five steps and were divided into three major stages, starting from reviewing previous studies (step 1 and 2), justifying production and collateral activities (step 3 and 4) before going to simulation and historical matching (step 5) (Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">By injecting gas into the gas cap and the oil rim, it is likely that P3 formation can retain much of its pressure while improving oil recovery through fluid displacement (Latil et al., 1980). With the implementation of gas injection, the pressure depletion rate varied depending on the injection point and the period of injection as shown in (Figure 7). A 300 to 400psi uplift in local pressure was also observed given that a higher amount of available injected gas volume was available in that period. (Mahalib and Schumacher, 2013).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Eventhough this validation method does not yield a perfect linear relationship, a linear behaviour is enough to define a good match (Craft and Hawkins, 1991). Nevertheless, a good match of the graphical method was obtained in terms of pressure history matching(Figure 8). The opposite would indicate poor compartment reserve quantification. In that case, stage 1 and stage 2 of the analytical framework would be subject to re-valuation for a better quantification of the unaccounted volume.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework, compartment East-Nose 3 was set as an example (Figure 9). The combination of three wells (EM4, EM15 and EM19) was initiated from two geographical reasons. Firstly, the three wells in question located to the left of thrust fault B, which has proven its potency in sealing and preventing possible crossflows. Secondly, EM 15 was a periodic injector and has influent radius of 1.5 km, where EM4 and EM9 fall into (Kabir et al., 1998).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">A comparison of pressure history between EM 4, EM15 and EM 19 displayed a similar trend, indicating the interconnectivity amongst wells(Figure 10). Particularly, a detailed study on downhole completion reviewed that all of EM 4, EM15 and EM 19 were perforated at the main sand unit P3-120/130. Additionally, EM4 and EM15 also have similar perforation level at P3-150 and P3-230/250 sand units, partially confirming a connection between the wells.</p><div id="link-10">
