<p id="Ancr2">Oil and gas production from the field started in 1965. A total of 55 wells have been drilled in field and most of these well are completed as oil wells while four of these wells are completed as gas wells in C6000A, C8000A and D4000A reservoirs. Two of the gas wells are completed in the C6000A reservoir while one each is completed in C8000A and D4000A reservoirs. The C6000A reservoir is a rollover anticline with minimal intra reservoir fault. The reservoir has fault assisted dip closure. The reservoir structural map is depicted in Figure 1. The gas production from the Galaxy North field is supplied into the Nigerian DOMGAS network.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The Galaxy North C6000A reservoir is a rollover anticline with mainly dip closure. Two gas wells (GALN001T and 043T) are completed in the reservoir and production started in 1984 (see production profile in Figure 2). The reservoir is supported by an active aquifer which provides about 80% of reservoir energy. The active aquifer support results to advancing GWC in response to gas production from the reservoir.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr11">These changes in the permeability-thickness indicate reducing gas column which is caused by encroachment of the Gas-Water contact in response to gas production from the reservoir. Additionally, the superimposed pressure derivative plots in Figure 10 displayed the changes in the infinite radial flow period. From the plot it could be observed that IARF stabilization is moving upwards indicating decrease in the Kh product.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">The analytical solutions which model these cases are called composite models. The most common analytical composite models are the radial and the linear composite. The radial composite is centered at the well with r as radius while the linear composite has L as the distance between the well and the mobility change. See illustrations of the radial and linear composite reservoir models in Figure 11.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">Note, at early time, the pressure will diffuse in compartment 1 only and the behavior will be homogeneous. When the composite limit is detected, there will be a change in the apparent mobility and diffusivity. For radial compsite system, the apparent mobility and diffusivity will move from the inner radius to the outer radius. See the radial composite pressure profile of the 2004 test in Figure 12.</p><div id="link-12">

The post production fluid contacts have been estimated from new wells drilled post production and well/reservoir performance data. Figure 13 show fluid distribution in the reservoir. The distribution show the contacts logged by the various wells that were drilled through the C6000A reservoir. The latest contact information has been taken from the GALN004 side track drilled in 2012.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">Since bottom perforation of GALN001T is very close to the WUT (only 6 ft difference), it is estimated that aquifer had encroached up to the bottom perforation of the depth at 6510ftss. It is therefore reasonable to assume that the present GWC is about 6510 ftss with some uncertainty range. This present GWC has been used to calibrate the fluid contact in the MBAL model and a continuous fluid contact movement profile has been generated using MBAL. The material balance results indicate that the reservoir is mainly supported by aquifer with energy contribution of about 80%. The MBAL contact, pressure and energy profiles are depicted in Figure 14.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr16">The pressure transient results have been used to predict the breakthrough condition of the GALN043T. The estimated distance to the limit of the composite reservoir corresponding to difference times have been plotted against the total underground withdrawals at these times. The plot was match with polynomial line with order of 2. An extrapolation of this line to the point where the distance is zero gives the total underground withdrawal at which breakthrough is expected to occur at the well. The water breakthrough condition plot is shown in Figure 15.</p><div id="link-15">
