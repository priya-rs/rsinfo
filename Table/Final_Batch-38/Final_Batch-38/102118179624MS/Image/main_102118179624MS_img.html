<p id="Ancr4">Large supplies of heavy and extra-heavy crude oils will be needed in Venezuela for the next coming years to replace the production decline of medium and light crude oils. Enhanced-Oil-Recovery (EOR, Figure 1) and upgrading techniques are required; being imperative to the development of technical and economic feasibility studies of the underlying development projects (Layrisse, I. et al. 1999), knowing that the risk and concerns on heavy and extra-heavy oil production remains: oil prices, environmental regulations, operating costs, etc.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">In the FPO, only 40–65% (depending on the site) of the oil-bearing formations are suitable for thermal methods (including both the development of horizontal wells; and targeting thick reservoirs); other beds are too thin, have too low kh/p values, and have unfavorable kv/kh ratios because of clay laminations (Dusseault et al. 2001). Based on the work of Zan Cheng (2010), the steam flooding is not recommended for thin extra-heavy oil bed of the FPO with horizontal and multilateral wells. Typical complex well configurations in one of the block of the FPO are reported by Cuadros, G. et al. 2015 (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">The oil was heated to 40°C, homogenized and submitted to decantation before determining its water content. This means that the 6 wt-% water measured by Karl Fischer method corresponds to a rather stable water in oil emulsion. This hypothesis is supported by microscopy (Figure 4) as relatively small water droplets are observed (typical size 1–5 μm). No further efforts were made to remove the stable water droplets in this study.</p><div id="link-4">

This means that the oil density was close to that of water at room temperature. For these reasons, adapted procedures needed to be implemented for handling the oil and achieving good separation of oil and water phases during the surfactant formulation design process or the analysis of the effluents of the coreflood tests.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">As this reservoir rock is unconsolidated, a specific procedure was applied to prepare the plug (Figure 6): the core was CT-scanned to select a fairly homogenous zone and the plug was drilled using a puncher. Due to the unconsolidated state of the reservoir rock, the depressurization of the core led to the formation of multiple fissures (see the CT-scan radiography): this means that the actual structure of the reservoir rock was likely not reproduced in the coreflood test and that notions of vertical and horizontal permeabilities are not relevant in this case.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr24">The corresponding relative permeability curves are plotted in Figure 21. It should be emphasized that the relative permeabilities were evaluated without considering, neither the effect of surfactant adsorption nor the control of the end-points with a capillary desaturation curve. According to the strategy selected in this work, all phenomena that occur at pore scale were captured macroscopically by the effective permeability coefficients.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr25">This explains why high residual oil saturation and low water relative permeability are found. The addition of surfactant to the injected water phase, in Exp. 2, leads to a reduction of the mobility of the water phase (above Sw ~ 0.35) and an increase of the mobility of the oil phase. Consequently, as shown in Figure 22, mobility ratio (mobility of the water phase over mobility of the oil phase), is clearly lower above Sw ~ 0.30 in presence of surfactant than without.</p><div id="link-22">
