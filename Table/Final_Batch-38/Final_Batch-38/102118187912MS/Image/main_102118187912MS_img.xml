<anchoringText id="Ancr2">The model runs for watercut and cumulative oil production for the first option are presented in Figure 1a-b. For comparison, the model was run without a CFW. It can be seen that the results obtained coincide with satisfactory accuracy. Satisfactory coincidence of the results was also obtained for the second option, as can be seen from Figure 2a-b. The difference in the results may be due to the fact that the pulsating pressure in the layers is not aligned instantaneously, as is assumed in the averaged equations. Thus, the presented results of the CWF runs, obtained on the basis of ordinary and averaged equations of two-phase flow, indicate their satisfactory coincidence. In this case, the run time of the averaged (2) and initial (1) equations differed approximately by 50 times, which indicates the efficiency of averaged equations for the CWF simulation.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr6">The results of ranking the sites by the CWF performance (using the η parameter) for this field obtained using a simulator and using an analytical solution, are shown in Figure 5. The maximum values of the η parameter were used, which were determined as a result of the variation of the period and the duration of the cyclic stimulation. It can be seen that although the η parameter values simulated and estimated using the proposed method do not coincide, the trends of their decrease are qualitatively similar. This makes it possible, with the help of an analytical solution, to calculate and select almost instantly 10-20% of the best from the set of all options, and then to search for the best one among them already with the help of a simulator. In practical cases, reservoir parameters are often known with not very good accuracy.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">Based on the results obtained at this stage, a number of promising areas were selected. One of these sites was recommended for the CWF implementation. Figure 6 shows the oil production profile before and after CWF. In order to observe the effect from the CWF, Figure 6 has the Kambarov's displacement characteristic [8] plotted on it. It can be seen that the CWF application led to a significant increase in oil recovery, since the magnitude of the effect was about 160%. This can be explained by the fact that the values of the water cut in the producing wells were about 98%.</anchoringText>
