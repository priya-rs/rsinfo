<p id="Ancr4">Decline Curve Analysis (Figure 3): The accuracy of automated decline curve analysis is improved through automated event detection, wherein trend breakpoints are detected mathematically (Castineira et al., 2014). These breakpoints may correspond to specific well events such as a choke change or workover; a field event, such as a change in backpressure; or a downhole event, such as a change in flow regime or drive mechanism. Any of these causes will necessitate a discreet decline curve fit, which is necessary for both future forecasting of each well, and for development of type curves to be applied for that well type or lift mechanism. Remaining reserves are estimated by well, and trends in EUR and PDP are identified by layer and block.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">This tool relies on a customized implementation of dynamic time warping (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978), which was originally developed to find the optimal time alignment between two time series. The algorithm was customized to take as input vetted formation top picks (i.e. manually validated/picked by a geologist) in a few key wells called pivot wells. The algorithm then proceeds to correlate these vetted interpretations from the pivot wells to their corresponding dependent wells (Figure 9). Pivot wells are critical to this tool because they provide key control data points that can assist the algorithm in areas of significant geological change due to faulting, stratigraphic pinchouts, or lateral changes in facies.</p><div id="link-9">

These workflows allow the incorporation of hard data points from logs as well as generic depositional trends specific to each zone (e.g. major fluvial/channel orientations) to quickly create fit-for-purpose models and maps. Despite the fact that 2.5D models have lower vertical resolution (i.e. one vertical cell per stratigraphic zone) compared to conventional 3D models, they capture the same lateral trends for any given zone and have the added benefit of being relatively easy to maintain and quality check.</p><div id="link-10">

The algorithm also calculates a drainage index (DI) for every completed zone, which is defined as the ratio of the completed HCPVT to the original HCPVT. In other words, small DIs reflect areas where only thin sand layers have been accessed/drained and therefore have more oil remaining in either overlying or underlying sand packages.
