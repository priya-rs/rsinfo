<p id="Ancr3">The field consists of two, overlaying, heterogeneous reservoirs each of which is divided into two layers of differing permeability. The reservoirs are moderately thick (tens of meters) with a typical permeability between a tenth and several Darcies (Figure 1). The reservoir simulation model is relatively large (200,000 active cells) and computationally expensive. The objective is to find the most appropriate control scenario for the multi-zone, ICV-equipped, production wells to optimize the oil/water displacement efficiency.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The reservoir uncertainty for the field was presented in the form of 3 realizations known as P10 (optimistic), P50 (base) and P90 (pessimistic). These had been built assuming that formation porosity and permeability, faults (locations and transmissibility), initial water saturation and reservoir net-to-gross were the major uncertainties. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the field oil production rate and NPV for these 3 realizations produced with fully-open ICVs, record the impact of expected level of uncertainty in the response space.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 4 shows the improvement w.r.t. the base-case versus iteration number for all realizations and for the objective function (i.e. the mean). The optimization was performed for 100 iterations at a computational cost of ~20 min/iteration using the 18 CPUs of 3.2 GHz frequency of a high specification, PC workstation. Total run-time = 100 × 20 min ≈ 33 hr. Figure 4 indicates that 85% of the improvement was obtained after 10 iterations requiring only ~3.5 hours computation time; confirming that it would have been possible to reduce the optimization time and achieve a close-to-optimum solution within a reasonable time for this relatively large, full-field model.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 5 shows the improved mean implies a higher expected added-value while the reduced variance (Figure 5-b) implies a higher reliability (lower risk) by applying the best ICV control scenario identified by robust proactive optimization. The maximum improvement (~ 4.3%) is obtained for the pessimistic scenario (P90); with smaller improvements (~ 1.3 % and ~ 0.2 %) for the P50 and P10 realizations, respectively (Figure 5-a). The flexible zonal-flow control provided by the I-well's ICVs improves the production performance compared to the equivalent base-case of fully open ICVs with no control (Haghighat Sefat et al., 2016b) while the optimization generally delivers a greater improvement for the less favorable realizations.</p><div id="link-5">
