<p id="Ancr1">Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) has been producing oil from the Upper Burgan formation for over 60 years from the Raudhatain and Sabriyah oil fields of North Kuwait (Figure 1). Both fields are essentially very large dome shaped anticlines that have been highly faulted and are structurally complex. Raudhatain Upper Burgan is North Kuwait's prolific producer under active water flood as well as with natural edge water drive. It's a mature Reservoir with water cut all over the field but still with lot of production potential. The Upper Burgan in the Raudhatain field consists of four major sand dominated layers that comprise the main producing zones.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The Upper Burgan Formation is the uppermost unit of the Burgan Formation. The Burgan Formation was deposited during the Albian period (Early Cretaceous) time and it is overlain by Mauddud Formation and underlain by Shuaiba Formation (Figure 2). The Upper Burgan reservoir is encountered at vertical depths of ~ 7600 feet at the crest of the structure in the Raudhatain field. The Upper Burgan reservoir in the Raudhatain field is approximately 160 feet thickness and the thickness varies in different parts of the field.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The Upper Burgan is represented by two end member depositional models in the Raudhatain field. These are a fluvial dominated, tidally influenced delta and a marine influenced shoreface model (Figure 3 &amp; 4). In the Raudhatain Field four major stratigraphic surfaces have been identified and these are regarded as flooding surfaces or transgressive surfaces that can be correlated on a field wide basis. These stratigraphic surfaces separate the four clastic intervals that have been identified as the UB2, UB3, UB4, and UB5 layers. These clastic layers are the oil producing zones. In the Raudhatain field the UB2 and UB3 layers have the thickest and highest reservoir quality sandstones, while the UB 4 and UB5 are the minor reservoir layers and these would represent the more marine influenced depositional systems.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">We can see from this typical Raudhatain well (Figure 5) that the UB5 and UB4 layers appear to be coarsening upwards sequences that represent the more marine shoreface deposits. The UB3 and UB2 layers however are thicker and often exhibit blocky or fining upwards sequences. These deposits are the fluvial dominated delta channel facies and are the highest reservoir quality rocks in the Upper Burgan Formation. The reservoir quality varies and is largely dependent on the rock type and depositional facies.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">It has been experienced in few wells and it's a problem associated with channel sands like Upper Burgan that the sand quality deteriorated as the lateral section moved away from the pilot hole. In such a scenario, the conventional passive ICD has limitation and cannot control the water production from different layers. To overcome this problem and to enhance the production from single wellbore by perforating all the layers with different oil water contact together, Field Development North Kuwait embarked on installing sliding sleeve ICD (Fig 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">Raudhatain Upper Burgan is a heterogeneous reservoir with layered sand shale sequences and has minimum pressure difference between the layers. The reservoir pressure, fluid properties, oil saturation and oil water contact were considered in identifying the location for Multilateral well. The well RA-xxxML (Fig 9) is located in eastern flank of the field with good oil saturation, viscosity ranges from 4 to 5 cp and reservoir pressure is about 2300 psi which is way above the bubble point pressure of 1300 to 1400 psi. It is decided to exploit UB3 upper and UB3 Lower sands with two vertically staggered laterals by commingle production.</p><div id="link-9">

Of these, two wells RA-xxxHST and RA-0yyyHST are side tracked wells where the sick producers in Mauddud reservoir is horizontally sidetracked in Upper Burgan reservoir. The initial production results showed that RA-000ML can produce about 5322 bopd with 0% Water cut in 48″ choke. The average horizontal per well production is about 1500 bopd and the best horizontal well RA-wwwH production is about 3145 bopd (Fig 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">The objective of Fast track water injection project was to address the pressure sink area at the crest immediately and to increase crestal pressure above bubble point. Using this project, identified an injector injecting in other reservoir (Raudhatain field comprises of multiple reservoirs) and converted as dual water injection. Another four sick injectors and producers (Fig 11) of other reservoir were converted to water injection in upper Burgan reservoir.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr17">RAUB production has been increasing gradually and currently it is producing oil at an all-time high of about 91 MBOPD with a water cut of about 42% (Fig 17). The increase in production is attributed to Field Development's aggressive approach of drilling horizontal/Multilateral wells coupled with ICD / SS ICD /ACID and installing more number of ESP's. Starting from the year 2004 to 2009 the oil production was stabilized at 35 MBOPD, then production started increasing with the installation ESP's and now the record level of production is achieved with the drilling number of Non-Conventional Wells. The Fig 17 shows the Production and Pressure performance of RAUB.</p><div id="link-17">
