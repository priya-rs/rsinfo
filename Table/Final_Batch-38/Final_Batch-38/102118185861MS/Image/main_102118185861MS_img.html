<p id="Ancr7">These problems have been mitigated by the introduction of the so-called Advanced Well Completion Technology such as annular flow isolation (e.g. Swell Packers) and downhole flow control (e.g. Inflow control devices (ICDs), interval control devices (ICVs) and autonomous flow control devices (AFCDs) (Fig. 1). Well monitoring capabilities are also generally more advanced with in-well, permanent sensors, including multiple pressure and temperature sensors ( Da Silva et al., 2012).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">Before analyzing the rela well data, the effect of an ICD completion on PTA was analysed with an integrated, transient, dynamic, coupled wellbore-reservoir model built with a commercial simulator. This was necessary to provide insight on how to approach the real data in the context of this problem. The wellbore model (Fig. 2) consists of a three zone, horizontal intelligent well with both nozzle type ICDs and ICVs for production control and monitoring. The flow path in this completion is designed such that the reservoir fluid first goes to the annulus through ICDs and then ICVs are used to connect the annulus to the tubing.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">The reservoir simulation model was built with 30*30*11 gridblocks and local grid refinement (LGR) ensured proper representation of the pressure changes near the wellbore (Fig. 3). The well is placed in the middle of a homogenous reservoir with no flow boundaries and the five connections per zone is designed to link the reservoir to wellbore. Both fixed flow rate and tubing head pressure were used for production control. The well test schedule is required the zones to be tested sequentially by closing the ICVs across each zone.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">Five distinct flow regimes (Fig.4) can be traditionally expected to be identified from the derivative plot (pʹ = dpwf / dlnt) during conventional PTA of horizontal well data, subject to the reservoir boundaries configuration. Each flow regime provides specific information about the reservoir and/or the completion. For example, the damage skin (Sd) and the product of the permeability in x and z direction (Kx.Kz) can be estimated from the early radial flow regime using for instance Eqn. 2, 3 and 4 (John Lee et al., 2003).</p><div id="link-4">

PTA is limited to the early radial flow regime in x-z plane and the evaluation of the (kx.kz) parameter. Straight line analysis estimated the Table 2 values of permeability and skin by use of Eqn.3 and 4 derived for conventional PTA. The smaller diameter ICD dramatically increased the estimated skin while retaining the same permeability product for all the three cases (Fig. 8). This skin represents both the damage zone and ICD pressure losses, and can no longer be used to estimate quality of the damage zone alon. On the other hand, the derivative plots (inversely proportional to permeability) are identical.</p><div id="link-8">

Our simulation assumed perfect downhole shut-in, hence the flow rate is a time independent parameter (i.e. sandface flow rate stops or starts nearly instantenously subject to the inter-zone interference), even though the plots for all three completions start at different pressure value due to their differing ICD pressure drops.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr30">The second data set is provided by well B, a three zone IW of similar completion design to well A. Fig. 24 presents the PTA of zone 3 for two PBU periods in Febraury and April which conducted after a production period with two different flow rate. There is small observable change in skin between the two PBUs but the quality of data is not as good as the Zone 1 in well A and the duration of the PBUs are even relatively short. This can affect the interpretation results and hence reduce the confidence interval. Nevertheless, the proposed workflow was followed for the longer and better quality data set in February resulting in ICD pressure drop of 0.63 psia which is equivalent to a ICD skin of 0.1, and therefore based on Eqn.12 the Formation damage skin of 0.34 (Table 6).</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr31">The level of stabilisation, which represents the permeability, should remain constant, while the separation between the level of the stabilization and pressure plots, indicative of the total skin, may change over time. Inconsistency in pressure plots can be due to ICD plugging/ erosion. For example, Fig. 25 shows three idealized cases where the effect of ICD plugging and erosion is compared. In this figure it is assumed that there are 30 nozzles per ICD joint, similar to the presented real field data. Increasing the pressure draw down, shifting pressure plot upward, or decreasing, shifting down ward, is the result of ICD plugging and erosion respectively.</p><div id="link-25">
