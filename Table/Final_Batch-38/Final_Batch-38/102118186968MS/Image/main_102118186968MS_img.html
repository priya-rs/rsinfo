<p id="Ancr3">The Java field is located in the lower area of the eastern part of the North West Java Basin. The North West Java Basin is separated to become four parts of the main epicenter basin, which includes the Jatibarang Subbasin, Cipunegara Sub-basin, Arjuna Sub-basin, and Ciputat Low (Figure 1). Regionally, the North West Java Basin is a back arc basin that is directly related to the Sumatra-Java Arc Trench system, but rifting process occurred during the Eocene in a different tectonic setting.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The Jatibarang sub-basin was formed as a half graben system controlled by normal faults with arcuate patterns. The N-S fault trend was formed when the subduction turned into an E-W direction. Ryacudu and Bachtiar (2000) explained that the Jatibarang sub-basin is releasing double-bend structure of the NW-SE right-stepping strike-slip fault zone system (Figure 2). This fault system (the OO-Brebes faults) was generated by N-S compressive stress during Miocene and is originally thought to be an extensional regime of the Cretaceous-Oligocene Meratus System that was rejuvenated during Miocene (Ryacudu and Bachtiar, 2000).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Due to the complexity of the fractured volcanic reservoir, it is very difficult for geologist to develop geological models of this reservoir. The most difficult problem after finding a fractured rock reservoir is to evaluate them, particularly their production and reserves (Luthi, 2005 after Suardana et al, 2013). In order to characterize this type of reservoir, an integrated study using a combination of seismic interpretation, open-hole logging, imaging log and coring is presented (Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The first step to characterization of a volcanic reservoir is to identify volcanic rock response on wireline log. As we known, volcanic rock is difficult to be identified because of its complexity in mineralogy and structure. Determination of volcanic rock facies was constructed by integrated analysis of mineralogical on petrography, image log and then by building a crossplot between NPHI and RHOB log to separate each facies of volcanic rock (Figure 4 and figure 5). The next step to characterize this type of reservoir is petrophysical calculation and facture attribute calculation.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">Distribution of fault and fractures both laterally and vertically has been carried out in the Java field by post-stack seismic structural attributes extraction including instantaneous phase, coherence and enhanced coherence (Figure 7). The enhanced coherence is a process designed to automatically interpret fault and fracture surfaces from 3D coherency volume. The enhanced coherence is occupied to generate rough fault picks in the entire volume throughout a series of processing phase that enable us to fully control the products at each step.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">It is concluded that the distribution of the production zone is mainly controlled by distribution of fractures beside by distribution of volcanic facies. The Jatibarang interval analyzed has a range of secondary porosity index of 2% – 12,0% and the range of fractures permeability value is 0,006 – 236 mD with average value is 42,90 mD. Correlation between several wells showed that the fractured zone is focused mainly in Jatibarang high with the depth of fractured zone from Top Jatibarang Formation is about 50 – 110 meters (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">Regarding this concept, It is concluded that the orientation of present-day maximum horizontal stress of the Jatibarang Sub-basin is north to south and this orientation has similarities with the present-day maximum stress of the Sumatera-Java arc trench system (Figure 9A). The results show that the fracture orientation in the enhanced coherence map is very well correlated with image log data so it can be used to produce drilling proposals to manage the deviation survey for future Java oil field development.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">The NNW-SSE major Fault 1 and NE-SW major fault 2 trend is interpreted as normal fault resulting from a tensional tectonic regime that occurred during Eocene when the compressive Meratus stress ceased. These faults controlled syn-rift deposition during Paleogene and were active as growth faults during the period. Schematic cross-section shows that one of the NNW-SSE and NE-SW major faults remained active until the end of the marine Talang Akar deposition. This is shown by the thicker Paleogene deposition on the west and east part of the study area side compared to the central side of the fault (Figure 10).</p><div id="link-10">
