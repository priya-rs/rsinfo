<p id="Ancr2">The Dolphin and Starfish fields are located in the East Coast Marine Area, approximately 75km off the east coast of Trinidad (Figure 1). The Dolphin Field was discovered in 1976 with the Dolphin-1 well and subsequently appraised by three wells in 1981 and one well in 1995. Production began in 1996 through a series of deviated wells from the Dolphin "A" Platform (DAP) with a second phase of development in 2008/9. The Starfish field was discovered in 1998 with first production occurring in 2014.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">In the case of Dolphin field, the dynamic volume estimates in some reservoir layers have been historically ~50-150% more than the static volumes, even after over 15 years of production. An example is shown in Figure 3 for a range of static vs. dynamic normalized GIIP estimates in one of Dolphin reservoirs.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The pore volume compressibility used instead in previous material balance studies was in the range of 6-12 microsips (10−6 psi−1). As shown in Figure 4 (Newman, 1973), this is very close to a typical range of 3-10 microsips, which is for consolidated sands as per Hall's (1953) correlation. In contrast, Newman's (1973) data for unconsolidated sands (GDA) have values up to 90 microsips, over an order of magnitude higher than the range for consolidated sands. The effect of compaction is not anymore negligible in the material balance equation, at this level of high pore volume compressibility (Fjaer et al., 1992 and Zimmerman, 1991).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The combination of the compaction effect with the new thin-bed modelling assisted in resolving the historical mismatch between the static and dynamic in place volumes. This was achieved on one side, by reducing the dynamic volumes using higher and more representative pore volume compressibility values for unconsolidated GDA sands. While on the other hand, static volume estimates increase through use of the thin-bed characterization methodology. This helped in better history matches of observed pressure depletion (as shown in Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The workflow for the Dolphin probabilistic modelling study is illustrated in Figure 6. Historical pressure and production data were extensively reviewed and compartments were identified based on the pressure depletion trends. Then, for the selected tanks, reservoir properties and volume uncertainty ranges were identified and explored in an integrated uncertainty tool and a material balance software with up to 1500 Latin Hypercube random sampling runs. A range of models that satisfy high confidence history matches were selected and P10, P50 and P90 GIIP ranges were identified.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">It was also realized that in most of the Dolphin reservoir layers, the wells are not in total isolation and some level of pressure communication exists between the wells and their compartments. Hence, the compartments in each set of comingled reservoir layers were modeled as tanks with transmissibility between them to avoid double counting the in place volumes. Figure 7 shows a tank setup for a set of comingled reservoir layers in Dolphin. In some cases, sensitivities were run for both merged and separate tanks for wells with similar pressure trends and reasonably proximal locations to test sensitivity of the outcome results to the aggregation of wells into compartments.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The outputs of the probabilistic material balance simulations were interrogated against the observed pressure data to find acceptable matches. A confidence interval of +/- 100 psi was used to determine the acceptable ranges of tank pressure match compared against the observed historical pressure points. Figure 8 shows the range of top 25 realizations with acceptable pressure matches in all four tanks of one set of comingled reservoir layers in Dolphin.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">The final step was to generate a cumulative probability distribution curve of aggregated in-place volumes for all the tanks in each set of comingled reservoir layers based on the acceptable ranges, as shown in Figure 9. The P10, P50 and P90 values were then identified based on the distribution. Also, as a sensitivity analysis, acceptable ranges were relaxed and top 25 matches extended to the top 50 matches and similar results and ranges were still observed.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr15">The methodology was developed as a robust workflow in the reservoir modelling software with embedded plug-ins developed to run spreadsheet macros. This facilitates uncertainty workflows for a range of probabilistic models with numerous static realizations and can automatically regenerate the three permeability models based on the stochastically generated porosity model. It assists in matching initial PLA results in each of the wells at the beginning of the simulation, and normally for the rest of the history, depending on the general quality of the pressure history match of the individual sands (as shown in Figure 14).</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr16">The output of the sensitivity studies highlighted the key uncertainties for each of the reservoir zones. It is important to point out that the uncertainty on saturation and petrophysical properties had a key impact for all zones. The depth conversion uncertainty had the biggest impact for some of the Dolphin reservoirs (as shown in Figure 15). These reservoirs have the largest hydrocarbon column such that structural flexing of the horizons away from well control has a large impact on GRV.</p><div id="link-15">
