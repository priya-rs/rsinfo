<p id="Ancr7">Figure 1 shows the awarded areas which are approximately 90 000 km2 with reserves of 20 6000 MMMboe enough for 15 years of production and 5 years of exploration. While all the 2P reserves are conventional, the majority of prospective resources correspond to conventional basins (18.2 MMMboe) and to a lesser extent by non-conventional formations (3904 MMMboe). In addition, this round comprises two stages of contracts that can be operated on joint ventures. The first stage includes 22 existing service contracts in Poza Rica-Altamira, Burgos and ATG Assets (Financed Public Works Contracts and Integrated Exploration and Production Contracts).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">The first tender of Round 1 comprised 14 blocks located in the shallow waters of the Gulf of México within the Southeastern Oil Basin (Figure 2). This first auction on July 2015 received only two successful bids on 14 blocks. Although bids were submitted for four other blocks (3, 4, 6 and 12), these bids were rejected as they fell below the minimum terms set by the government.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">The second tender of Round One occurred on October 2015 and it comprised 9 fields divided into 5 areas in the shallow waters of the Gulf of México within the Southeastern Oil Basin (Figure 3). This tender had 15 participants (five more than in the previous tender) that submitted bids individually (5) and in consortiums (4). The minimum royalty payments for these blocks ranged from 30.2% to 35.9% and all of the areas were awarded with almost double the minimum requested.</p><div id="link-3">

In addition, the fields were classified in two types depending on the hydrocarbon volume contained. Type 1 corresponds to fields with a volume of less than 100 MMb (21 fields) whereas fields with a volume equal or greater than 100 MMb were classified as Type 2 (4 fields) as shown in Figure 4.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr12">Mexico’s oil production can be divided in four geographic areas: Northern Region, Southern Region, Southwestern Offshore Region, and Northeastern Offshore Region (Figure 6a). However, Figure 6b shows that most of the production corresponds to the Northeastern Region that comprised the giant fields Cantarell and Ku-Maloop-Zaap.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr13">Considering that the production trend of Cantarell and Ku-Maloop-Zaap determine the trend of Mexico’s total oil production (Figure 7), in this section we use a probabilistic method based on decline curve analysis (DCA) to forecast production of these two fields.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr14">Figure 8 shows the result of applying the previous methodology to both fields. This production forecast assumes only natural decline and disregards any Enhanced Oil Recovery programs that PEMEX will implement in the near future. Thus, the successful application of these programs would guarantee a production of 200 thousand b/d from Cantarell for the next five years (Silva, 2015).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr15">It is important to note that the results are approximate because they are derived from a methodology that considers various assumptions. Nevertheless, the information obtained still allows us to have an idea of the future trend. For instance, we can derive a forecast considering the production decline in these two major fields pertaining to the Northeastern region and assuming that the rest of the regions continue increasing or maintaining the current production level as shown in Figure 9.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">Figure 10 shows the average breakeven of the most important oil plays. It can be seen that the highest extraction cost in the oil industry correspond to shale and oil sands. Therefore, North America production growth might not reach the 9 MMbd by 2035 (BP, 2015), as this production growth was expected to come mainly from tight oil (4 MMbd) and oil sands (3 MMbd).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr18">The electricity sector has been a growing natural gas market in Mexico where natural gas nearly accounts for 60% of Mexico’s power generation (Clemente, 2015). Figure 11b and Figure 12 show that Mexico will remain as an importer of dry natural gas. Besides, the import capacity is likely to increase through new pipelines making the country able to import at least 4000 MMcfd of natural gas from shale gas locations in the U.S.</p><div id="link-12">
