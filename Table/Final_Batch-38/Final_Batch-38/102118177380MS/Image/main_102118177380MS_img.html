<p id="Ancr4">The Steamflooding process was applied on a sector in the main pay of South Rumaila Oil Field, located in South of Iraq about 50 km west of Basrah and about 30 km to the west of Zubair field as shown in Figure 1 (Al-Ameri et al., 2009). The field is associated with large gentle anticline fold. Dimensions of the sector under study are about 11 Km long and15 Km wide (Al-Ansari, 1993). Figure 1 shows the geographical locations of Rumaila oil field in addition to current well distribution. The South Rumaila Field is divided into four production sectors. From north to south, the sectors are Qurainat, Shamiya, Rumaila, and Janubia where the sector under study includes Rumaila sector and small parts from Shamiya and Janubia sectors.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The thermodynamic flow model was used to evaluate the reservoir through Steamflooding process and predict its future performance. The constructed grid in this model includes the reservoir and parts of aquifer along the eastern and western flanks. The three-dimensional modeling is performed over 15 x 11 x 5 grids in the I, J, and K directions, respectively. The reservoir in vertical direction is divided into five vertical layers. The grid construction and well locations are shown in Figure 2. The 15 x 11 x 5 grid models contained 825 cells, of those, (584) cells or (70.8%) are active. The grid blocks areal dimensions are uniform and equal to (1000 m x 866 m). The vertical permeability within each layer is assumed to be one tenth of the horizontal permeability at each grid blocks (Al-Ansari, 1993).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">Consequently, and in order to capture as much as levels of variation given all factors, Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) was considering as multilevel, low discrepancy and more uniform experimental design approach (White et al., 2001). LHS was adopted to test 13 reservoir and fluid variables whether they have an effect on flow response and to find out the optimal scenario of maximum oil recovery. Figure 4 shows how LHS is a uniform space-filling design. The resulted full DoE model was evaluated and validated through stepwise regression as a deterministic approach and Bayesian Model Averaging as a stochastic model to eliminate the non-influential factors on the flow response through Steamflooding process.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">BMA creates multiple models to be optimized based on the posterior distribution and Bayesian Information Criteria. In the computed BMA Occam’s window, the optimal model has maximum posterior probability and minimum BIC; meanwhile, the non-influential predictors are eliminated when the probability of a non-zero predictor coefficient is less than 50% for the best sampled model. The best models are the ones with posterior probability sum equal to one (Hoeting et al., 1999).

<p id="Ancr16">Since the stepwise regression is not an efficient way to justify the most influential factors, Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) was adopted as a probabilistic approach to create multiple models rather than one deterministic model. The parameters selection process in Bayesian Model Averaging depends on a competition between posterior probability of response factor for each likely model. The models are generated after transferring all the factors into normal distribution and models are created from factors’ distributions sampling as shown in Figure 13. Five factors have long vertical spike that represent the probability of factors being zero is high. Therefore, these five factors shown in Figure 13 have no effect flow response and should be eliminated from the model.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr19">Finally, Steamflooding has proven its effectiveness to improve oil recovery by facilitate water approaching into the reservoir after removing the bitumen barriers at the oil-water contacts. All these improvements were done through only one-steam injectors that has more flow connections with produc-tion wells (Al-Mudhafer and Altaee, 2014). Figure 16 shows the original solution with base and defaults setting of static and dynamic factors, respectively. Among 256 simulation runs, the optimal scenario has led to increase oil recovery factor from 61% in original Steamflooding case to more than 90% from the optimal case.</p><div id="link-16">
