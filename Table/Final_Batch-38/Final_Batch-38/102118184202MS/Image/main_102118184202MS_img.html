After pump installation well was put on production and was closely monitored to observe any issue with the pump performance on insert anchor. The pump successfully completed 1 year of run-life. Post success of this job, Insertable anchor was used in the entire fields install down-hole pump in wells with profile-less string.

<p id="Ancr8">MBH-A is horizontal fracced well in the barmer-hill formation. Well was initially on self-flow and then was put on jet-pump. But with jet-pump, the operator was not able to give the required draw-down. It was decided to produce the well on sucker rod pump. The pilot for installation of hydraulic rod pump unit was conducted for this well. The well has packer completion with 7" casing and 3-1/2" tubing. SSD has been installed in the well for jet-pumping. Please refer to Figure-8 for details on completions.</p><div id="link-8">
