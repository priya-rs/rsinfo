<p id="Ancr7">Although the minimum royalties requested by Mexican government considered values between ranges of 1% to 10%, the offered royalties by bidders were the following: 14 fields with values higher than 60%, 6 fields between 40% and 60% and 5 fields with values below 40%. The minimum royalty value was limited by the geographical location of the fields, complexity and cost of development for each area, as well as original volume in place. Fig. 2 shows adittional royalties given by each company.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">Production history per field, total number of wells, potential areas to workover and drill new wells were considered areally and vertically, in case some potential targets were not produced. The potential production obtained were forecasted (Fig.3) using decline analysis to contemplate fields and wells behavior for each of the activity visualized: base case, workovers, well services and new wells. The sum of all these activities were aligned with the necessity of the block, facility capacity installed combined with remaining reserves.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">Using a specialized software (Fig.4) and considering the best scenario per field, a preliminary economic analysis of 20 years was created. This study considers a variable oil and gas price (forecast published by third party) and the difference and price volatility between Brent oil and Mexican basket. The use of economics helped to reduce uncertainties and optimize Net Present Value (NPV).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">Economic analysis results (Table 3) show operating margin costs between 1.2 and 2.4 USD/Mcf and development-operational costs from 1.6 to 4.1 USD/Mcf. NPV in Fig. 5 suggests the option of 3 fields to be operated for the first winner without any constraint and 2 fields probably for the second winner. Unfortunately, 3 fields are at risk of being returned to the government.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">Fig. 6 shows that Ponton is the field with higher NPV in this area, this is mainly affected by additional royalty offered (61.5%) rather than expected EUR (0.8 million barrels of oil). On the other hand, Barcodon shows higher EUR (3.0 million barrels of oil), with higher additional royalty (64.5%), impacting its economic evaluation.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">Economic analysis results (Table 6) show operating margin costs between 3.4 to 28.0 USD/STB and development-operational costs from 10.0 to 80.0 USD/STB. NPV in Fig. 7 suggest the option of 4 fields to be operated for the first or second winner without any constraint. On the other hand, 8 fields have high potential to be returned for the government (since they lead the list of fields with major losses).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr13">Fig. 8 is a comparison and summary of NPV, operating margin and development-operation costs charts. Colors suggest that 11 fields have high chance to be operated by the first or second winner with low risks, investment values are between USD 5 and 43 million. On the other hand, 14 fields have high potential to be returned before 2 years production period (even if the second winner takes possession of the field, the level of risk can be high for some cases), investment values vary from USD 6 to 73 million.</p><div id="link-8">
