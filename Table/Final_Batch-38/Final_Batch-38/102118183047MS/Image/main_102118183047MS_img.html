<p id="Ancr15">Since 2007 LPG import has increased significantly as the growth of domestic supply cannot keep up with the pace of LPG demand. Figure 1 shows the development of LPG demand, domestic production and import. LPG is primarily (94%) used in residential sector. Other sectors that use LPG are industrial and residential sectors. The proportion of LPG use in 2011 is shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr17">In the future, LPG demand is expected to continue to grow with economic and population growth and also because the kerosene-to-LPG conversion program is still underway, especially for households outside Jawa. LPG demand is projected to reach around 7.2 million tons in 2020. To satisfy the increasing LPG demand, import of LPG is projected to continue to grow as the growth of domestic supply is limited (see Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr19">Methanol is produced from synthesis gas, which can be obtained from steam reforming of natural gas or from gasification of coal or biomass. Today the most common feedstock of methanol for DME production is natural gas while methanol from coal is not economical because three to four times higher capital cost than natural gas to DME and vast CO2 treatment cost are required. Conversion of natural gas into DME comprises two processes: conversion of natural gas into methanol followed by conversion of methanol into DME (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr20">The yield of natural gas to DME conversion is high. According to the Industry standard in methanol, 850 KTPA (Kilo Ton per Annum) of plant capacity, which require 90 MMSCFD of natural gas as feedstock, is most economical and such amount of methanol could produce 600 KTPA. DME production will require the supply of water for steam reforming and for utility (Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr21">Production of DME from natural gas may be carried out near the gas field and ship the DME to the major DME markets. Other option of DME production scheme is to convert natural gas into methanol near the gas field, ship the methanol to a location near to the DME major market where it is then converted into DME (Figure 7). This study will investigate the two DME production schemes.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr22">Indonesia is endowed with significant amount of natural gas reserves. As of January 2011, the total of Indonesia gas reserves is 157 TSCF, comprises of 108 TSCF proven reserves and 49 TSCF potential reserves (probable/possible reserves). These reserves are spread in many different regions of the country (see Figure 8). It is also shown in the Figure the potency (resources) of coal bed methane (CBM), which is considered as new type of energy source in Indonesia.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr23">Indonesian gas reserves are exploited to produce LNG for export, to satisfy domestic gas demand and for export as piped gas (to Singapore). Between year 2000 to 2011, Indonesian gas production varies between 6.9 BSCFD (2.5 TCF/year) to 8.2 BSCFD (3 TSCF/year). Figure 9 shows the development of gas utilization during 2000 – 2011 for different gas consumers. One can see from the figure that LNG export accounts for nearly one-half of the national gas utilization in 2011.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr24">Gas price setting basically is resulted from “business-to-business” negotiation between producers and gas buyer. However, the formal/official decision is in the government hand. As a comparison, Figure 10 shows the development of international gas price including Indonesian LNG. Except for the USA, Indonesian gas price is comparable with international gas price (LNG and EU market).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr27">The main market of DME is Jakarta while the gas sources are far away from Jakarta. Whether the scheme is Methanol-DME plant built near gas source or Methanol plant built near gas source, both will involve sea transport/freight which is not cheap. Therefore transportation/freight cost (as DME or as methanol) will be an important factor in DME project economics. The destination of the DME/ methanol ship is Jakarta’s port. Geographic map of transporting the DME/methanol from various alternatives of gas source based DME plants is shown in Figure 13.</p><div id="link-13">
