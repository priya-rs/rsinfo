<p id="Ancr1">Once the stimulation treatment is completed, and injection stops, a temperature log can be run across the treated formations in multiple passes, and the temperature decay profile will provide an indication of which zones received fluid (Fig. 1). While temperature surveys provide a reliable and low cost estimate of which formations took fluid, and perhaps the fracture height (in a vertical well), they do not directly indicate which perforations received proppant, nor the propped height of the fracture treatment. Proppant detection tracers can accomplish some of this, and will be discussed later in the paper.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The primary diagnostic methods used to identify the shape and extent of the SRV are microseismic and tiltmeter mapping. In these methods, microseismic sensors or tiltmeters are generally located in an array on the surface or in an adjacent observationwell during the hydraulic fracture treatment. The small microseisms or deformations in the earth are recorded and then used as an indirect measurement of where fracture fluids and slurry have been placed in the subsurface [Mayerhofer 2008]. Typical analyses yield a mapshowing the extent of the SRV (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">After the fracturing operations are complete, the well is then surveyed using a spectral gamma ray log which can be interpreted to identify the isotopes in the near well-bore (Fig. 3). Advantages of this technique include its relatively low cost and multiple isotopes. The primary disadvantage is the necessity to handle radioactive materials (both during the fracture treatment as well as after proppant flowback), as well as the need to log the well within two months of the fracture treatment due to the short half-life isotopes. Another proppant tracing method currently available places very small amounts of a high thermal neutron capture cross-section tracer (HTNCC) into ceramic proppant grains during manufacture [Smith 2011]</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">These tracers can be placed in either every grain for treatments that employ 100% ceramic proppant, or in the case of treatments that employ sand or other non-ceramic proppant, ceramic grains containing higher concentrations of the HTNCC can be mixed in and replace a small portion (5%) of the designed proppant. In both cases, a pre- and post-frac neutron log is run across the zones of interest, and the change in neutron response yields an estimate of proppant location (Fig. 4). The primary advantage of this method is that the tracer is not radioactive, and no special handling is required. In addition, the tracer is an integral part of the proppant grains, so the well can be logged at any time in the future.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The final coating consisted of a proprietary initial coating which promoted the adhesion of the outer conductive layer to the substrate (Fig. 5). Several tests were performed on the prototype detectable proppant to ensure high electrical conductivity, particularly at downhole pressures, temperatures and pH. In addition, fracture fluid stability tests were performed with lab-created samples of the detectable proppant in order to verify that the proppant was compatible with typical borate-crosslinked guar gel fluid systems. This test was then repeated with samples of the final manufactured proppant in the actual fracture fluid scheduled to be used in the field test.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">In addition, the well was planned to be hydraulically fracture stimulated using 16 plug-and-perf stages, with 200,000 lbm detectable proppant to be pumped in the final stage closest to the heel of the wellbore. It was hoped that placing the detectable proppant into the final fracture stage would allow for the current source tool to be placed as close as possible to perforations without special tractoring operations.

<p id="Ancr9">The bow springs of a centralizer would flatten against the casing under compression, creating a significant contact area with the casing. Spring steel is fairly durable and is expected to withstand multiple trips into and out of the wellbore. Furthermore, modeling suggested that when coupled with weight bars attached below the centralizer, placement of the tool through the curved section to at least the 60-degree inclination point should be possible using gravity alone (no tractoring or pumping down). The centralizer was modified by the e-line company such that the center conductor of the e-line cable would be soldered to the bow springs with multiple redundant wraps to assure electrical continuity and durability (Fig. 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">Based on a balance of availability, cost and forward modeling, a total of 20 receiver stations were designed. In addition to measuring e-field signals, there was also interest by the design team in capturing magnetic field (b-field) signals, since a signal response in the b- field was predicted to be higher by one of the models. Thus, two of the twenty stations also incorporated horizontal magnetic coil sensors (also oriented orthogonally) to capture b-field response (Fig. 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">The final determination of each of these issues entailed balancing the technical merits with the associated time (and cost). Since the proposed far-field proppant detection technique involves the use of a differencing technique, a minimum of one measurement before and one measurement after the conductive proppant is placed is necessary. Other issues considered were the timing of these two measurements that would yield minimal disruption to the fracturing operations, as well as what noise would be associated with each measurement. This eventually led to the final recommendation of four separate measurements shown in Fig. 11 and described below.</p><div id="link-11">

Modeling suggested that the cable/drum would not exceed the upper limit temperature allowed for the armor shield on the cable, which was rated to 500° F. However, extra precautions such as using real-time drum temperature monitoring and recording (Fig. 13), and limiting maximum allowable temperature to 325° F as a safety factor, were added to the existing experimental procedures.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr14">Finally, it was important to insure the specialty proppant for this test be stored and retained on location such that it was used only for the correct stimulation treatment stage. To accomplish this, one of the proppant storage silos was designated by the pumping company to be dedicated only for the detectable proppant. Once the proppant was transferred into the silo from bulk transport trailers, the silo was disconnected from its energy source, pneumatic transfer caps were sealed, and clearly visible markings were placed on the unit to prevent the unit from being used at any point other than the designated stage for which the proppant was intended (Fig. 14).</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr16">Measurement A provided several positive results and observations. A cursory look at the signals being received by the receiver arrays indicated an electric field signal was being carried to surface, and the waveform was remarkably similar to the input transmission (Fig. 16). Technicians were pleased that these were accomplished with ~14 amps of transmitted current. In addition, while the EM signals were extremely small, they matched the forward modeling expectations quite well. This led to confirmation that the proppant detection methodology using electromagnetic sensing was sound.</p><div id="link-16">

However, using a basic smoothing filter of the data from each of the receivers, several preliminary inversions have been performed. Most of the preliminary analysis and inversion work has been done on the “C minus B” differenced data, which represents the two measurements taken immediately before and after the stage placing the detectable proppant.

<p id="Ancr18">The visualization also presented what appeared to be a “gap” in the proppant in the southwest quadrant of the PRV, or the area located near the first (uphole) perf cluster. The external portion of this feature is apparent in Figs. 17c and 17d. The visualization tool developed can also create customizable cut-aways of the PRV (Fig. 18). Cut-away views along the lateral show the positioning of the perf clusters in relation to maximum proppant height. It appears that the largest downward growth (of detectable proppant) occurred in the first two perf clusters, while the maximum upward growth occurred in the last two perf clusters. In addition, one can clearly see the aforementioned “gap” in proppant when viewing the Figs. 18b and 18d.</p><div id="link-18">

<figcaption><b>Figure 18 </b> Additional views of the preliminary differencing of the C minus B data. In this case, crosssectional cut-aways are illustrated in both the “east-west” [(a) and (b)] and “north-south” [(c) and (d)] directions. The (a) and (b) views cut at the wellbore, and show the four perf clusters. The (c) view is a lateral cut at the last perf cluster, while the (d) view shows the first perf cluster. Views (b) and (d) more clearly illustrate the “gap” in proppant detected near the first perf cluster.</figcaption>
