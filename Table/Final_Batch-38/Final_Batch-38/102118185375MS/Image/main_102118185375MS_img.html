<p id="Ancr5">LHSC reservoir has a fault-nose monoanticline structure, as Fig.1. The average reservoir thickness is 78.4m, and it is divided into 4 zones, S31, S32, S33, and S34. It is also divided into 12 subzones, 40 layers, and 93 sublayers. Among them, S33, and S34 are the main oil zones, with crude oil viscosity of 14.5 mPa-s, reservoir temperature of 66 °C, and formation water salinity of 3570 mg/L.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Firstly, the injection pressure of a part of the injectors increased by a high value during injection, so booster pumps were added in the surface injection system of the relating injectors to fulfill the injection demand. Later, it was found that the preposed slug caused formation plugging, leading to SMG main slug hard to be injected into deep reservoir. So the SMG particle diameter had to be decreased. Although the relatively smaller SMG particle could access the deep formation, the role of SMG was discounted. As Fig.2 showing, from December 2012, the oil rate increasing effect was affected and started to decrease.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">The process can explain the mechanism of NPF technology. SMG performs the behavior of temporarily plugging, breakthrough, re-plugging, re-breakthrough, and so on, and the water in the dispersion can be diverted into relative low permeability area or small pores, and displace the remaining oil. This mechanism determines the long lifetime of SMG. As Fig.3 and Fig.4, the production curves of the two typical producers showed the same behavoir.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">The water injection profiles of the 10 injectors show that the water intaking thickness is increased from 51.2% to 60.7% by NPF. As Fig.5 showing, for injector L68-60, before NPF, the water intaking thickness and layer number are 15.0m and 5 layers, and the water intaking thickness ratio is 28.1%. After NPF, the water intaking thickness and layer number are 38.6m and 11 layers, and the water intaking thickness ratio is 72.3%. So the water intaking thickness is increased by 44.2%.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">As Fig.6 showing, for producer L69-561, before NPF, layer 28 is the main liquid producing layer, taking up 56.7% of the total liquid production. After NPF, the liqiud of layer 28 is decreased, taking up 42.3% of the total. The liquid production ratio of the low liquid producing layer 46 is increased from 3.6% before NPF to 10.6% after NPF.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr11">Due to the plugging during chemical injection, the oil rate benefit curve has a cave in the middle, and it can not explain the real EOR effect. Numerical simulation method was used. As Fig.7 showing, after matching the real production history until now, the oil rate increasing effect of 10 years was predicted, see the curve A in Fig.7. After matching the real production history of the waterflooding phase, the slug injecting parameters were optimized to make the injection smooth and eliminate the effect of plugging and pressure boosting, and the NPF conduction was simulated again to predict the EOR effect, as curve B.</p><div id="link-7">
