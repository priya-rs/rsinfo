The main reservoir intervals are further split into multiple stratigraphic intervals (Figure 1) for mapping and well planning. Siltstones, lignites and shales bound the sands vertically and shales thicker than 10’ are considered as effective seals for hydrocarbons.</p><div id="link-1">

The four well locations are superimposed on the net pay map of AMV-125, the deepest stratigraphic interval (Figure 2).

<p id="Ancr6">Heavy and extra heavy oil viscosity is a strong function of temperature, unlike light oil. Figure 3 shows a typical dependence of Huyapari dead oil on temperature. The significant depth variation in this field across the large operational area causes significant change in reservoir temperature (Tankersley and Waite, 2003) and hence, significant variation in oil viscosity at in-situ conditions. Representation of accurate reservoir temperature and associated oil viscosity is critical to obtain a reliable production forecast.</p><div id="link-3">

IP estimated by averaging provided a better assessment of sustained rate than allocated calendar rate values.

Figure 6 shows that on average the effective well length is 80% of the drilled lateral length for this reservoir. Figure 8 captures the scatter of IP vs. effective well lengths (calculated per the criteria outlined in Table 2) of wells completed in AMV-125 sand of the Lower reservoir. Wells with higher effective length showed better performance (higher IP) than those with lower effective length.

<p id="Ancr12">The IP shows a strong and clear trend with depth (Figures 9a and 9b), with IPs increasing with increasing reservoir depth. This is caused by lower oil viscosity (due to higher temperature) and higher pressure in deeper reservoirs. As mentioned earlier, the field has a large depth variation and a geothermal gradient causes the reservoir temperature to increase with depth. The viscosity variations with temperature and reservoir depth are shown in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr17">The dynamic reservoir simulation model shows that local heterogeneity results in a wide range of fluid production rates for these wells. The forecasted range of performances from the simulation model (Figure 14a) was comparable to that observed in the field (see Figure 9). However, the individual well forecasts (using base model without any calibration) did not generally match the actual performances. On the other hand, forecast on a group of wells (Figure 14b) or at a pad level compares very well with field data. In other words, pad-level or a group of well-level forecasts are more reliable than well by well forecast because of local heterogeneity, which may not be precisely captured in the geologic model.</p><div id="link-14">

Connectivity through these patchy areas resulted in pressure communication between the vertically stacked flow units during production; as a result, forecasted cumulative oil production for the target sand were affected by ~10%.

<p id="Ancr19">In the area under consideration, the geostatistical model honored well log data (Figure 15) of high shale volume (VShale) at the target stratigraphic interval top, but areas away from wells showed low VShale and high permeability regions (Figure 16). Connectivity through these patchy areas resulted in pressure communication between the vertically stacked flow units during production; as a result, forecasted cumulative oil production for the target sand were affected by ~10%. Model calibration to production data helped to incorporate a regional barrier between the vertically stacked intervals, making them separate flow units with no vertical communication.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr20">Although, frictional pressure drop is an important consideration in the horizontal well design, heterogeneity largely dictates inflow along lateral. The oil inflow profiles are generally non-uniform (Jha et al., 2009) and oil rates calculated in the flow simulation models were higher in the areas of higher permeability (Figure 17). Some portions of the well did not contribute because of locally poor quality reservoir. These non-contributing zones can occur anywhere along the well. In this well, the percentage of non-contributing zone (~20% for this well) calculated from the model is comparable with the average non-effective well length (as % of drilled length), calculated using the cut-offs presented in Table 1.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr23">Figure 20a and b show reservoir pressure at a midway point between two horizontal producers (for 16 sets of horizontal well pairs) at different times for the heterogeneous model (shown in Figure 13a). Figure 20 clearly shows that with time, significant reservoir pressure reduction occurs at the midway point. Further, it shows that at any given time, there is a large variation in pressure depletion. This is caused by varying degree of interwell reservoir connectivity in different parts of the reservoir because of local heterogeneity. Figure 20 shows that, on average, midway pressures reduce by about 50% in ~ 8 years from the start of production.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr24">Figure 21 shows the field data for infill wells drilled after eight years of production. These infills were drilled midway between the existing wells. The initial oil production rates (IPs) of two infill wells are much smaller than the IP of existing wells. The field data essentially corroborates the observations made from numerical study that the late time infills’ performance will be much worse than the existing wells IP due to lower reservoir pressure and higher oil viscosity compared to the initial condition. In fact, the current performance existing wells may be used as an analog for intermediate to late time infill well IP estimate.</p><div id="link-21">
