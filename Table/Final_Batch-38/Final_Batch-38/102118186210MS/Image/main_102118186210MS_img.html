<p id="Ancr5">The conventional GAGD process is carried out by drilling a horizontal well under the pay zone and injecting gas through existing vertical producers at the top (or into the gas cap) (Mahmoud &amp; Rao, 2007; D.N. Rao, Ayirala, Kulkarni, &amp; Sharma, 2004; Dandina N Rao, 2012). When gas is injected, reservoir fluids segregate due to gravity and gas pushes the oil downwards into the horizontal producer. Gas displaces oil and sweeps the heavier fluids into lower perforations as in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The GAGD Huff ‘n’ Puff process for the fractured basement has some modifications from the conventional GAGD method in that gas is injected via the annulus of the well into the reservoir, swelling the in-situ oil to some extent and migrating upwards to be an “artificial” gas cap at the top of the reservoir. Consequently, the existing WOC would be “pushed” down locally, reducing the water cut and increasing the oil rate of this well (based on Huff ‘n’ Puff-type) after reproducing.

<p id="Ancr8">The figure below demonstrates the direct communication between the two wells Y-12P and Y-24P. In the depth slice figure (Figure 3), the blue triangles are the producing faults (fractures) which are the main production contributors of the wells. From the figure, it is clear that the two wells Y-12P and Y-24P intersect the same fault at the end of their respective trajectories. That fault serves as the common conduit between the two wells, thus leading to direct communication between them. It is also possible that there might be a network of fractures (not just one fault existing between the two wells), because, as previously explained, minor fractures tend to develop along the main fractures and there could be other fractures intersecting that fault directly.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">In June 2014, a gas injection test was conducted for Y-12P and showed that around 4MMscf/d could be injected using the existing gas-lift compressor, with the outlet compression capacity of 1,700psig. Gas was injected via the annulus into the reservoir for 2 days at a rate of 3.5 MMscf/d and the injection pressure of 1,700 psi. For the last, approximately 12 hours gas rate increased to 4.0 MMscf/d, bottom-hole pressure and wellhead pressure increased sharply immediately to reach a plateau of about 2,100 and 1,650 psi, respectively. Figure 4 demonstrates the performance of this injection test.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">Sensitivity analyses were conducted for several fluid conditions ranging from completely mixed to non-mixed/immiscible. In E100, the immiscible condition was modeled using the DRSDT keyword (units Mscf/stb/day), which controls the increase of solution gas-oil ratio (GOR). If the DRSDT value is set to zero, the injected gas is completely immiscible to the in-situ oil. In the other case, simulated producing GOR was lower, approximately 0.1 Mscf/stb/day, than the observed data (see Figure 6). Therefore, in the simulation of the pilot test, a moderate assumption for DRSDT value of 0.1 / 2 = 0.05, or 50 scf/stb/day, was selected.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr16">Asphaltene Flocculation was detected as a function of depressurization at reservoir temperature (266°F) for reservoir fluid and hydrocarbon gas mixtures of 40 mole % and 55 mole %. The lab results defined the asphaltene envelope (Figure 11), formed from the asphaltene onset pressure (AOP) locus and the bubble point line. Figure 11 confirms that asphaltene deposition will occur only if reservoir pressure and gas fraction fall within the envelope. Under the controlled parameters for the pilot test (Qinj = 4 MMscf/d, bottom-hole pressure = 2,200 psia) it is not expected to enter the envelope and therefore it was concluded that it would be safe to inject gas into the reservoir in Y-12P.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr25">From that point of view, it can be observed that the Cumulative Gas Injection parameter correlates extremely well with that parameter: the more gas injection the higher the cumulative water-free oil production (as demonstrated in Figure 18 below). It is too early at this stage to deduce such a statistical relationship since there are only four data points. However, it is important to realize such a correlation between the two variables and when more data become available the relationship can be fine-tuned to provide better estimates for future cycles.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr26">Figure 19 below compares the injection characteristics of the four cycles. It can be seen from the figure that there is a similar linear relationship between the Cumulative Gas Injection and the Injection Time up to a certain threshold of the Cumulative Gas Injection or Injection Time. The behavior, then, starts to deviate from the common straight-line relationship at breakpoints as shown in cycle 1 and 2. Starting from that breakpoint, the slope or gradient becomes less steep or reduced which can be interpreted as showing that the time required to inject a certain volume of gas becomes higher.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr27">That data indicated that in the first two cycles, the last portions of injected gas might have not fully migrated and/or stabilized yet (still re-equilibrating, migrating near the well Y-12P) thus producing more volume of gas right after re-opening. If that was the case, the “migration ratio” (as shown in Figure 20) could be used as a quantitative measure to determine the optimum Shut-in Time i.e. if it was considered that the gas had been more completely migrated in the last cycle, the Shut-in Time in the first two cycles should be lengthened (lower migration ratio) to achieve the same desirable response.</p><div id="link-23">
