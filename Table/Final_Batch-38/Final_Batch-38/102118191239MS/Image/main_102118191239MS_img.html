<p id="Ancr7">The Takutu basin (Figure 1) is a large Mesozoic graben in the southwestern area of Guyana and northern Brazil. The basin is an ENE trending Jurassic-Early Cretaceous continental rift basin about 40 km wide and 280 km long. Webster, 2004 states that prior exploration documented a stratigraphic section dominated by mudstone but including Jurassic lacustrine source shale, siltstone, evaporites, and basalt. Webster, 2004 states Hunt Oil Co. began operations in the basin in the 1980s with a three-year exploration program including field geology, photo geologic mapping, several methods of surface geochemical prospecting, reprocessing, and acquisition of SAR, aeromagnetics, and 1,331 km of new seismic.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr11">Workman &amp; Birnir, 2015 indicated that the basin evolved from a failed rift arm which extends on trend to the Takatu Basin to the east straddling the borders of Guyana and Brazil. The basin architecture is described as a trap door structure plunging from the Pomeroon Arch and abutting against the Demerara Plateau (Figure 5 with the basement being formed by the Atlantic Unconformity. Overlying the unconformity are: the continental Barremian Stabroek Formation, the Aptian Potoco Carbonate that gradually drowned and finally by the deposition of the Canje Formation which contains the regionally deposited source beds.</p><div id="link-5">

The Canje Formation was deposited (approximately 90 million years ago) during the time that South America and Africa drifted apart at the Equatorial Atlantic Transform Margin (Figure 6) and is believed to be the same source rock found in petroleum systems associated with significant petroleum discoveries in West Africa.</p><div id="link-6">

An estimated 120 MMscf of natural gas was produced daily, with 20 MMscf used on the FPSO for electrical power generation, steam generation and to supply the processing and utility facilities (Tullow Ghana Limited, 2009). The remaining gas would be injected back into to the reservoir for pressure maintenance and improved oil recovery. Tullow Ghana Limited, 2009 stated that water injection commenced at the start of production to maintain reservoir pressure for oil recovery.</p><div id="link-7">

The injectors were drilled based on the location of the aquifer using water saturations and layers in the CMG model to choose the location of each of the four injectors. The reservoir, as shown in Figure 9, demonstrates the position of the aquifer throughout the different layers (2 – 11) and the area where the four injectors would be drilled. The injectors were also placed down-dip of the producers.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr17">Gas injection occurred from 2020 – 2027, before the three gas injectors were converted to producers. An increase in the gas oil ratio and gas saturation coincided with the cessation of injection. Gas migration from the gas cap into the oil leg and production from the gas cap as the injectors were converted to producers. Production from the gas cap lead to rapid decline in reservoir pressure as shown Figure 11.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr18">Continuous water injection was implemented for the Liza field development and the maximum voidage rate ratio (VRR) or voidage replacement ratio as it is commonly known for the project was 1.14. There was a sharp decrease in VRR in 2027 corresponding with the end of gas injection as shown in Figure 12. The gas cap expansion and reinjection of produced gas for pressure maintenance contributed in reservoir volume production. An overall VRR greater than 1 suggested that the volume injected exceeded the volume produced which would explain the high volumes of water produced.</p><div id="link-12">
