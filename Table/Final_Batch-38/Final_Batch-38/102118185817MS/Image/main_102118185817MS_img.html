<p id="Ancr3">The Golden Eagle Area Development is located in the UKCS approximately 100km North East of Aberdeen and comprises the Golden Eagle, Peregrine and Solitaire fields (Figure 1). The three fields are produced via a combination of platform and subsea wells, from three drill centers: a wellhead platform adjacent to the central processing platform (Golden Eagle wells), a Southern manifold subsea drill center (Peregrine wells) and a Northern manifold subsea drill center (Golden Eagle and Solitaire wells). The platform wells were drilled using a heavy duty jack-up rig and subsea wells were drilled using a semi-submersible rig between March 2014 and October 2016. Production commenced in October 2014 and water injection shortly thereafter.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The development strategy for the Punt is also via waterflood, but using a pattern flood along the length of the Punt channel. This is because the Punt sands are fully oil bearing across most of the Golden Eagle accumulation with sand pinchout to the east and west, and the structure only dips below the free water level in the extreme north and southeast of the field. Punt producers are located towards the Punt sand highs, with injectors generally in the structural lows. Producers and injectors alternate along the axis of the Punt fairway with a higher density of producers towards the crest of the structure near the 20/1–8 appraisal well, where the greatest thickness of net pay is encountered (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">A completion schematic for a three zone production well is shown in Figure 3. This shows the location of the pressure and temperature sensors immediately above the ICV for each zone. The uppermost gauge mandrel is a combined flowmeter and pressure/temperature sensor. A three fiber cable bundle is clamped to the inner production string, and across the three reservoir intervals Upper Punt, Lower Punt and Burns in this case. One of the fibers within the bundle provides distributed temperature sensing for inferring the water injection profile during shut-in warmbacks, although the resolution has proved to be insufficient for production inflow profiling.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The well was put on production in June 2015. Well start up rates and pressures are shown in Figure 4. Due to the initial temperature profile being disturbed by the completion fluid circulations, the only usable TTA dataset was identified from 15th June, when the top two zones, 1 and 2 are closed (their pressure build-up curves are clearly seen in the annulus pressure plot) while the bottom zone 3 is open and is being cleaned-up with gas lift assistance. This instantaneous increase in zone 3 rate resulted in a representative temperature transient response. The pressure build-ups for each zone were also interpreted and the zonal properties were identified. These were used to verify the TTA results.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Such ICV cycling in well A was performed in November 2015. The well watercut at this time was negligible and the well had been producing from just the top two zones. The ICV positions, surface choke, and zonal pressure and temperature measurements during the cycling are shown in Figure 5. The best drawdown events for Zones 1 and 2 are observed when their flow rates instantaneously increase due to the ICV 2 or ICV1 shutin respectively. These events will be used for Zone 1 and 2 TTA. The data gathered in the ICV3 cycling event at the end of the test will be used in multi-zone analysis.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">Instantaneous closure of a zonal ICV causes the fluid trapped in the zone’s annulus to compress, resulting in its warm-up (for liquids). These features are commonly observed and an example is shown in Figure 8:</p><div id="link-8">
