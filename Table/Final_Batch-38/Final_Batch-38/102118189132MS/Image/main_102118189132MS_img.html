<p id="Ancr4">While Soi remains constant as it depicts the initial reservoir condition, the Sor values is dynamic. Sor can decrease with good reservoir practice and enhanced recovery mechanism thus implying that Sor is a controllable parameter. Sor exist because of the inability of the viscous force and/or the gravity forces to completely overcome the capillary forces. The relationship between the three forces is expressed by the Capillary and Bond numbers expressed in figure 1 below.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Areal sweep efficiency is defined as the fraction of the total area of the oil reservoir that has been contacted by water. It is usually delineated as EA. The vertical sweep efficiency (delineated as EV) on the other hand is the fraction of the reservoir thickness contacted by water. EA and EV are better depicted as shown in figure 2 below.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">The reservoir has good well coverage with a total of 9 wells completed on it (see Appendix 1 &amp; 2). This practice encourages a good EA. Perforations from most of the wells have been optimally placed carefully considering sand quality and water contact (see Appendix 9). In cases where perforations were not crestal (well 6 and well 10), nearby wells with shallower perforations (well 5 and 32) are sufficient to recover any attic oil in the affected well.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Although no BHP was acquired during the short period of production, there are two strong indications of good aquifer support. Firstly, the well when closed-in (for flowline failure- see Appendix 3) was still producing at a BSW of 78 %. This is indicative of a good aquifer support. Secondly pressure depletion analysis of all other produced/producing reservoirs in the field indicates &lt; 10 % pressure depletion. These outcomes indicate a very high Ee.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Forty-Nine (49) Bottom Hole Pressures (BHPs) have been acquired over the 40-year period of production from all the wells. These pressures, acquired from the different wells, when plotted over time (see Appendix 4) clearly indicate rapid pressure equilibration and fluid connectivity. This dynamic observation strongly supports the initial static observation on reservoir connectivity strongly indicting a very high EC.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">The implication of this is that oil can be produced even at very high BSW which indeed was the case (see Appendix 4). supporting a high Ee. Although ED is not within control, as stated earlier under the primary recovery phase, for EPUK F0000A a high ED was observed. An approximate quantitative analysis of the RST acquired in 2013 from one of the flushed wells (see Appendix 5) indicate remaining oil saturation between 15 – 20%. This result implies that an ED estimate of 76 – 82 % is possibly at play.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr12">The reservoir has good well coverage with a total of 4 wells completed on it (Appendix Apendix 6 &amp; 7). This practice encourages a good EA. Perforations from most of the wells have been optimally placed carefully considering sand quality, water contact and the gas contact (see Appendix 7). Production from the reservoir began in 1972 and has continued to date. Production has been largely well managed as the general performance diagnosis of the wells indicates that the overall production philosophy over time was based on good wells and reservoir management practice. The implication of this practice is a good EV.</p><div id="link-9">

Production was brief starting in 20001 and ending in 2004 (about 4 years- see production profile in Appendix 1). The well was horizontal (with a horizontal leg of ~1650 ft) and as such had a good area contact with the oil.

<p id="Ancr19">Over 26 BHPs have been acquired over the past 44 years of production. The pressure depletion analysis indicates a depletion of 4 % (see Appendix 9) over this period indicating a strong water drive. This is further buttressed by the BSW seen from the producing/produced wells (&gt; 80 %). An example for one of the flushed wells is shown in Appendix 13. These positive attributes invariably lead to a high Ee. The intra reservoir faults picked by the acquired seismic is not extensive which establishes fluid continuity and connectivity (see Appendix 6).</p><div id="link-16">
