<anchoringText id="Ancr16">To investigate the water-rock interactions, samples were selected from Swenson core in Well No.1 of the Lower Eagle Ford (140 ft long) in the Maverick Basin (Figure 1). This location has been selected due to distinct heterogeneities present vertically in that well.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr17">The collected samples were divided into five chemofacies and named LEF1 through LEF5 from top to bottom (Figure 2). Classification was made based on stratigraphic variations in elements (Ca, Si, Al, K, Fe, S, U, V, Ni and Mo) and total organic carbon concentrations (Amin et al., 2016). These elements are selected either because they are major elements (Ca, Si, Al, K, Fe and S) that make up of the minerals in Eagle Ford, or because they are redox sensitive trace metals (U, V, Ni and Mo) that provide information on paleoenvironmental conditions at the site of deposition of organic-rich mudrocks (Tribovillard et al., 2006; Wright and Ratcliffe, 2010).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr18">Dynamic experiments were achieved through core-flooding experiments on 280 g crushed rock samples for three hours at 242°F to 244°F and 75 psig. The core-flooding experimental system consists of a core holder, a temperature controller, a separator and a pressure controller, which is used to simulate reservoir condition (Figure 3). Deionized water was continuously injected at 18 ml/min rate. During the experiments, temperature of the system was continuously recorded.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr19">Loading plot and score plot are often used in PCA. Loading plot in Figure 4 is used for interpreting relations among variables (elements). Variables which are close have high correlation. Based on it, the major elements in static experiments were classified into three groups: 1. Ca, Mg and Sr are a result of the dissolution of carbonate; 2. K and Na come from rock particles by cation exchange 3. Al, Si, Rb and Fe are derived from dissolution of clay minerals. S is independent and may come from dissolution of pyrite.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr22">ANOVA and PCA also were applied in dynamic experiments. ANOVA results show there are no significant differences in these elements between chemofacies. PCA obtained similar results as static experiments: Ca, Mg and Sr are coming from dissolution of carbonate and K, Si, Al and Rb are coming from dissolution of clay minerals or cation exchange (Figure 7). All samples scattered in the score plots and cannot be distinguished because there are not enough elements that can be used in PCA.</anchoringText>
