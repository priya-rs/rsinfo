<p id="Ancr6">Located in northeastern China (Figs. 1 and 2), Daqing Oilfield was discovered in 1959 and is currently the second largest oilfield in China. It is a large inland fluvial delta-lacustrine sedimentation reservoir with multi-layer and high reservoir heterogeneity (Pu, et al. 2009). The major oil-producing blocks of Daqing Oilfield include Lamadian, Saertu and Xingshugang, the total area of those three oil-bearing blocks is 917.1 km2. As one of the giant oilfields, Daqing Oilfield plays a key role in providing domestic oil to meet China's increasing oil demands.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">According to preliminary statistics in 2016, 209.0 million tonnes oil was produced by commercial ASP flooding in 24 major blocks, with 8482 injection and production wells in total. Fig. 3 shows the recent implementation scale of ASP flooding technology in Daqing Oilfield, and ASP flooding is now a comparable EOR technology to polymer flooding.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">Although WASP can weaken the impact of scaling, the injection pressure of WASP flooding still increases fast (Nie, 2017), as presented in Fig. 4, so further measures should be taken. Through using a compound scale removal agent (YC-36 +12.0% HCl+2.5% NH4F+1.0% Fe stabilizer +0.3% corrosion inhibitor) proposed by Guan (2016), more than 98.0% of the scales can be removed according to laboratory tests.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">SP flooding technology was developed to entirely avoid oil well scaling problem and to make the treating process of produced liquids easier. Comparing with ASP flooding, when the negative effects of alkali was eliminated, SP flooding is more likely to make the full use of polymer viscosity and elasticity (Fig. 5), which will surely contribute to higher sweep efficiency and increased oil recovery. In addition, EOR mechanism of ultra-low interfacial tension also works for this flooding system (Jiang, 2011).</p><div id="link-5">
