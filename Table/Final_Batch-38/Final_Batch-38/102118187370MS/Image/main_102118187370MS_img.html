<p id="Ancr1">When the bit or BHA fails, it leads to non-productive time (NPT) for the operator and high repair costs for the service provider. For this application in South Texas, drilling a curve and lateral into the Austin Chalk formation, (Fig. 1) these challenges are no different from most directional applications. The formations’ interbedded nature, with varying unconfined compressive strength (UCS), creates an environment that is prone to dynamic instabilities such as torsional vibrations or stick-slip.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The unit is inserted into the fixed blade of a PDC bit, it is held in place with a threaded retainer, and has a diamond element that engages with the rock to act as the DOC control feature (Fig. 2). The element, when under a constant load, gradually retracts, increasing the aggressiveness of the bit, to allow for a larger drilling DOC. Removing the load, the DOC reduces and the element very quickly extends to remain engaged with the formation. In addition to this inward and outward movement, the self-adjusting unit has the ability to resist sudden increases in loading conditions or DOC.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Of the motor runs in this area, on average 52% are pulled for DTF or downhole motor failure (DMF). This also coincides with the dull of the bit, where typically bits are pulled in a 2-4 or 1-6 condition and show indications of chipped teeth as per API dull grading specifications.

<p id="Ancr4">The operator agreed to the proposal of running an 8 1/2-in. self-adjusting DOC control bit with six blades and 5/8-in. cutters. This was the first opportunity to use this technology to drill a directional well. The goal of the application was to drill the curve and lateral with one bit and BHA. Because this application used a directional motor assembly, it used a commercially available in-bit sensing device (Ledgerwood et al) (Fig.4). This allowed post run analysis to occur and determine what vibrations were happening at the bit.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">This allowed post run analysis to occur and determine what vibrations were happening at the bit. It is possible not to see the vibrations in a string-recording tool due to any de-coupling effect of the downhole motor. To compare performance of the self-adjusting DOC control bit, the operator in this area of Karnes County, Texas (Fig. 5) had drilled other Austin Chalk wells on the same lease. To validate the performance of the first run, a follow up well drilling into the Austin Chalk using the self-adjusting DOC bit also occurred.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Capturing high-frequency data at set increments from the in-bit sensing tool allows for verification of smooth drilling, using the recorded RPM as an indicator of torsional oscillation or stick-slip. Fig. 6 shows an example of stick-slip in a non-associated run with Fig. 7 showing the smooth drilling from this run. It is important to note the difference in scales between the two plots, with the self-adjusting DOC bit run having a very narrow consistent RPM response. The bit drilled into the lateral for 3,914 ft before pulling it for DMF. The bit in Fig. 8 was rig site dull graded as a 0-1 worn teeth.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The overall performance of rate of penetration was an average 63.4 ft/hr, with a total distance drilled of 4,949 ft in 78 hours. Comparing this to the offset wells on the same lease, there is a significant indication of how the overall performance measures up. The self-adjusting bit saved the operator over 100 hours for comparable footage that resulted in a savings of 150 hours for the entire well, which is demonstrated by the day curve comparison in Fig. 9. The vibration data shown in Fig.10 indicates a stick-slip free run with a consistent and narrow RPM band.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">For this well, it was approximately 2 miles from the previous run. Tripping the bit in at 11,888 ft, it drilled to land the curve at 12,943 ft in 23½ hours. The bit proceeded to drill into the lateral section until 17,315 ft, and was pulled due to a motor failure. Drilling total footage was 5,427 ft at an average ROP of 66.2 ft/hr in 82 hours. The bit was dull graded a 1-0 with chipped teeth, Fig. 11. To complete the well, the consecutive bits drilled the remainder of the lateral of 2,058 ft, graded 4-4 lost teeth, and 1644 ft graded 0-1 worn teeth.</p><div id="link-11">

When compared to offsets on the same rig, within 6 miles, the bit drilled faster to the same depth in one run versus the nearest offset. The section drilled by the self-adjusting bit displaced what typically took two to four bits to get to a similar depth as seen in Fig. 12.</p><div id="link-12">
