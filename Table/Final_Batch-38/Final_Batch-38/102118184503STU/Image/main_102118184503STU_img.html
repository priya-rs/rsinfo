<p id="Ancr2">To date, the West Verden Hoxbar Unit, shown in Figure 1, has been developed with a rough 5 spot waterflooding pattern with approximately 4 wells per section. This translates to 160 acre well spacing, and 320 acre pattern spacing. Since a typical waterflood can be on a quarter of that spacing or less, this field's existing 32% recovery factor (as of summer 2015) can be surprising. Moreover, an additional 8% of recovery is achievable with the implementation of low cost workovers across the field.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The depth of the Hoxbar formation is roughly 9700 feet, with a single net pay zone of only 3.3 ft and a completed net to gross ratio of 1:10, all shown in Figure 2. The completed net pay zone is bounded on top and bottom by what appear to be impermeable shale layers. With only a single completed zone, many typical waterflooding optimization opportunities were unavailable to me, e.g., plugging off one zone to perforate another.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">I began by studying the field and waterflood results to date. Figure 3 shows a map of net pay for the West Verden Hoxbar Unit. The mapped area shows the full extent of the field, while the border shown in bright blue indicates the unitized portion of the field, which is the area I focused on for my study. This map shows that net pay ranges from around 1 to 5 feet through most of the field, with an average of 3.3 ft, which is very thin compared to most formations with economic waterfloods. For the unitized area, original oil in place was about 10 million barrels, and recovery factor as of summer 2015 was 32% throughout the field.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">To get a better sense of the relative roles of primary and secondary recovery in the overall 32% recovery factor for the field, I turned to decline curve analysis. Figure 4 is a plot of logarithmic oil rate plotted against Cartesian time, and shows full field decline curve analysis. Primary recovery in the field prior to implementation of the waterflood was 5%. However, additional infill drilling was done following the implementation of the waterflood, and in that situation it is difficult to determine what additional production is additional primary recovery and what production is due to the waterflood.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 5 is a plot of logarithmic oil cut vs. Cartesian cumulative oil production, which can be used much like decline curve analysis to analyze the performance of a waterflood and predict ultimate recovery. Roughly 500,000 barrels of oil had been produced when waterflood activity began in the field. At 3,000,000 barrels of cumulative oil production a straight line developed, and I felt confident extrapolating this trend to an assumed economic limit of 1% oil cut, indicating an ultimate recovery of 4 million barrels of oil.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 6 is a plot of primary and secondary oil recovery plotted against water input, which is a graph that can be used as a waterflood performance indicator. In a typical waterflood, this graph typically has a high initial slope at the onset of the waterflood, and then flattens at water breakthrough. However, this graph shows that the WVHU waterflood has not yet plateaued and has been rising at a consistent slope since its inception. Figure 5 suggested a 4 million barrel recovery objective, and this curve is consistent with the idea that there is more oil to recover, and that the current waterflood is capable of doing so with strategic development.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">I chose to evaluate my waterflood from an injector-centered-pattern basis. In Figure 7, the red numbers show what pattern recovery was as of summer 2015, and the patterns themselves are green if recovery factor was greater than 30% and red if recovery factor was less than 30%. It is clear that the central area of the field, and generally the eastern side of the field, has experienced the best waterflood performance, with poorer waterflood performance around the edges of the unit or the western side of the unit. With this trend in mind, I focused my optimization efforts around the edges of the unit.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">Core Labs performed a core study in 1997 with cores taken from the WVHU #9 and #14 wells. This was a study commissioned by the operator at the time, and nothing was done with the results for over a decade, but these cores proved helpful for my analysis by shedding some light on the waterflood efficiency calculation. As shown in Figure 10, the core flood showed that recovery factors of 52 to 63% were achievable in lab conditions, but beyond a recovery factor of roughly 40%, each additional pore volume of water inputted recovers such little oil that the waterflood certainly becomes uneconomic.

<p id="Ancr12">However, in Figure 11, laboratory flood recovery from the well #14 core are plotted against waterflood results from the field and confirms that field performance closely parallels laboratory results. Therefore, an overall recovery factor of roughly 40% when taking into account all three factors contributing to waterflood recovery is not only reasonable, but is also the recovery factor I moved forward with when identifying optimization opportunities for this field that would target the areal sweep component.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">As a waterflood develops over time, water is consistently injected into the same injection wells and then flows through the targeted formation, pushing unswept oil along with it toward producing wells. However, once the injected water has contacted the same areas of the formation for an extended time, the waterflood ceases to produce additional oil because it isn't contacting any new oil in the established flow paths. The benefit of pattern realignment, illustrated in Figure 12, is to convert existing producers to injectors, which will then create new flow paths through the unflooded central areas of existing patterns, displacing untouched oil toward remaining producers in patterns.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr14">Figure 13 details the economics of a single conversion. Assuming a capital cost of $350 thousand, which is extremely conservative, and an initial increase in production of 57 BOPD 6 months after the capital expenditure occurs, this project will be economic at oil prices as low as $29 per barrel. If the current strip reflects a $45 per barrel oil price, the initial uplift in production can be as low as 36 BOPD and still meet all of the investment evaluation criteria of the operator of this waterflood.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">The dominant benefit of this approach to increasing recovery is that it does not require drilling new wells to increase production. Conversions can typically be implemented for 1/10 the cost of drilling a new well. My recommendations are currently being implemented in the West Verden Hoxbar Unit, with two identified pilot locations shown in Figure 14, because my studies show that the conversions are economic at oil prices as low as $29/barrel, pay for themselves in less than 2 years, and extend the productive life of the field by over 10 years.</p><div id="link-14">
