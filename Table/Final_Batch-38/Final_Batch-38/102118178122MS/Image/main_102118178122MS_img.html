<p id="Ancr1">The XYZ field (Fig. 1) under study was discovered in September 1977. It is the second largest field in western offshore India. The oil production is mainly from the Bassein, Mukta, and Panna formations. Generalized stratigraphy of the Mumbai offshore basin is depicted in Fig. 2. Major part of the in-place oil exists in the Bassein formation, and the reservoir has been a prolific producer. Chronic decline in reservoir pressure and oil production led to implementation of water injection in late 1990s to provide layer-wise pressure support. Increase in water injection resulted in sustained oil production for a few years but at a cost of increased water cut.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">Major part of the in-place oil exists in the Bassein formation, and the reservoir has been a prolific producer. Chronic decline in reservoir pressure and oil production led to implementation of water injection in late 1990s to provide layer-wise pressure support. Increase in water injection resulted in sustained oil production for a few years but at a cost of increased water cut. Later, infill wells were drilled to see the improvement in oil production. Currently, the field is producing at average oil rate of 41,000 barrels per day (BPD), with average water cut of 65% and GOR 149 v/v. Average water injection is 145,000 BPD.

<p id="Ancr4">In the study reported by Rao et al. (2004), they presented a flow pattern for the WAG injection process to account for the fact that the accumulated experience from several WAG field projects contradicted the high expectation from the process. The flow pattern is depicted in Fig. 4. It considered the natural tendency of the injected gas to override and of the water to underride. Based upon the same consideration, a flow pattern for SWAG injection has been depicted in Fig. 5. It shows the advantage of injecting water and gas simultaneously over sequential injection</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">To evaluate the effectiveness of the SWAG method, a pilot project was introduced in the field. The pilot design of SWAG injection consisted of five wells of the AA platform. AA is the platform with the most oil production of the XYZ field, comprising nine producer wells and four injector wells (Fig. 6). Of the five wells chosen for the pilot study, four injector wells and one producer well are placed in the five-spot injection pattern. During the water injection process, there is more influx of injection water in the wells lying on the rising flank of the basin.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">The amount of variation of the flow regime from that of the expected fine bubble flow behavior helped to identify the most suitable completion strategy among the three wells. Wells with small distance (about 2 m) between the perforations and the tubing shoe had the preferred injection regime, with minimal segregation in the casing section compared to the well with a large (about 6 m) distance between the perforation and tubing shoe (Fig. 8). The best completion strategy would be the one that allows the injected mixture of gas and water to enter the reservoir in the form of fine bubbles. Results of the production logging survey indicate that the following points should be considered during candidate selection of SWAG injection wells:</p><div id="link-8">
