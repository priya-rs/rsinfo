<p id="Ancr6">The pilot area shown in Fig. 5, is located in the segment containing producer P-15 and injector E-4 H. Both wells were put on line in August 2002. The STOIIP in the drained area of the model (the main fault segment) is about 7.6 MSm3. The P-15 water breakthrough came about 12 months after the initiation of water injection in E-4 H. At the start of the silicate pilot in 2013, approximately 9.4 MSm3 of water had been injected in well E-4 H, and approximately 3.1 MSm3 of oil and 5.9 MSm3 of water produced from the segment. The segment also includes the producer P-11, which was open only for a short period in 1995/1996.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The stratigraphic column for the pilot area consists of the Statfjord Grp. The upper part of the group has a high net-to-gross and well-connected channel sands. Pebbly sands with very high permeability are found in this part (grey dots in Fig. 6) and they are a likely location for a thief zone between E-4 H and P-15. The lower part of the Statfjord Grp. has a lower net-to-gross and more isolated sand bodies. A possible correlation of sand bodies between E-4 H and P-15 can be seen in Fig. 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The testing and commissioning phase continued when the vessel entered into the open water of the Baltic Sea. Final testing and commissioning was to be implemented on the vessel’s arrival into the North Sea. During the commissioning phase, challenges were encountered with the pre-filtering process for the RO units that are required to remove large particles from reaching the RO membranes. Initially 10 micron absolute Amazon filters were used. During the commissioning test particles in the seawater clogged the filters more frequently than expected. Hence, the Amazon filters were removed and replaced by twin pod Cartridge filter units as shown in Fig. 8.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">Prior to the vessel’s arrival on the field, a 3 inch Black Eagle riser hose was connected to the subsea template and anchored to the seabed. The installation of the riser hose was performed from an IMR-vessel (Inspection, Maintenance and Repair vessel) with work-class ROVs (Remote Operated Vehicle). On the surface, the hose was connected to a buoy with a wire. The buoy/wire allowed the crew on the pumping vessel to spot and lift the end of the hose to the vessel with a winch, see Fig. 9. A connector system was installed on the surface end of the hose and in the bow loading area of the ship. The connector system was a so-called Hot Make Hot Break (HMHB) designed for enabling connection/disconnection also when the system was pressurized.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Based on continuously monitored well pressures, an aggregate reservoir transmissibility is used to monitor changes in the resistance to flow through the reservoir segment, see Fig. 10. Transmissibility is defined as the ratio between the total flow rate and the difference in bottom-hole pressure between the injector and the producer. The bottom-hole pressure in the injector is readily derived from the recorded wellhead pressure, while the bottom-hole pressure in the producer is obtained from a downhole pressure gauge.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">Fall-off wellhead pressure data in E-4 H (no bottom-hole pressure was available) have been used to monitor the changes in mobility as a result of the silicate injection. Representative pressure and pressure derivative fall-off test data have been plotted in Fig.11. The pressure derivatives (circles) can be investigated with respect to changes in mobility. The green curves are fall-off data prior to the silicate injection, the red curves during and immediately after the silicate injection, and the blue curves are more than half a year after the silicate injection. Early data, prior to about 1 hour, are influenced by wellbore storage and poor shut-ins, which have masked the infinite acting radial flow.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr16">Generally, the H2S concentration increases with increasing number of circulated pore volumes of injection water. A change of sweep pattern will increase the portion of produced injection water from areas with a lower degree of circulation, and could result in temporary lower H2S production. The H2S measurements from P-15 displayed in Fig. 15 show that the increasing trend of H2S before silicate injection has stabilized at a lower level after the silicate injection.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr17">Injector E-4 H injects water above the oil-water contact, and hence alteration of the drainage pattern will sweep more oil to the production well. As mentioned above, the EOR volume from the in-depth water diversion in the pilot area at pilot sanctioning was estimated to be moderate due to high permeability and relatively good reservoir flooding also outside the thief zone. Fig. 16 shows that the alteration of the drainage pattern has resulted in a decrease in water cut of 2–3% as estimated at pilot sanctioning.</p><div id="link-16">

The production in P-15 was shut in for some months late 2012 and the first part of 2013 due to operational problems in the water injection (lack of data in Fig. 17). Fig. 17 indicates a flattening of the decline in oil rate after the silicate injection, but when modelling the net effect on increased oil production the numbers will be influenced by a possible change in operation regularity of water injection.</p><div id="link-17">
