<p id="Ancr7">Two test wells in Eddy County New Mexico were made available for this work: 1) The Barbie State No. 3 well, T19S, R27E, section 13, which is located in the Millman field and produces from dolomites and sandstones of the Grayburg formation; and 2) The Federal 00 # 3 well, T21S, R27E, section 18, which produces from fine grained sandstones of the Delaware formation in the Cedar hills field (Broadhead et al., 2004). Figure 1 shows the location of these two test wells.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">The DataLogger was designed and implemented to be as simple and small as possible by choosing small chip-based accelerometers, a microcontroller, memory chip, and batteries. The final design version contains only three chips, one lithium battery (CR1025), and two capacitors. Figure 4 shows the configuration of the DataLogger and a bench testing implementation inside an appropriately sized shell.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr11">The software for the DataLogger consists of two parts: Control software written into program memory inside the microcontroller; and data processing software, which runs on a workstation or laptop PC to process recorded data and compute the path/position by integrating the recorded accelerations. Chip level processes are illustrated in Figure 5; from top to bottom: a battery is attached to the DataLogger, the microprocessor initializes, the accelerometer initializes, the flash memory initializes, an interrupt is set that pauses writing until a change in orientation is measured by the accelerometer, when movement is registered the microprocessor reads data from the accelerometer and writes it to the flash memory.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr15">The Viper Drill can be deployed on cased or open-hole completed wells. On cased wells, a casing milling bit is first used to form a hole in the casing; then the coiled tubing is pulled and the drill string is attached for the formation drilling process. The Viper Drill can drill out at 90° from 5.5 in. or larger casing, and at higher angles from smaller casing. This allows its use in the majority of mature stripper wells in the USA. The Viper Drill then creates a hole in the pay zone by utilizing a rotating, mechanical drill bit on the end of the Viper Drill string (Figure 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">Early in the workover of the well, problems with the surface equipment arose. While the casing and cement drilling string performed flawlessly, some unexpected issues arose with the formation drilling-string and probe tool-strings. For example, on the first run of the formation drilling tool the drilling head was lost in the lateral due to stick-slips. The project also experienced problems with the initial probe that conveyed the sensor (Figure 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr18">After the initial set of field tests at the Barbie#3, a second generation DataLogger was developed for the Federal 00 #3 test, in part due to much longer trip times in the deeper well, and also due to continuing development of chips used in the design of the DataLogger which also allowed the inclusion of a gyroscope and compass to the data stream. Figure 12 shows the schematic of the new DataLogger designed with the upgraded Main Processor (MPU-9250), accelerometer (PICLF1825) and larger flash memory (IS25LP128).</p><div id="link-12">
