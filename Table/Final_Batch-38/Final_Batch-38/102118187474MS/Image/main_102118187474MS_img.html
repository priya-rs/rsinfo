<p id="Ancr5">The San Andres formation is a regressive carbonate-evaporite sequence deposited on broad platforms and shelves in the Permian Basin (Fig. 1). It is a very prolific and important conventional reservoir in the Permian Basin. It is a progradational stratigraphic unit consisting predominantly of carbonate facies (Ramondetta 1982). The lithofacies consist of dolomite, laminated anhydrite, and massive bedded anhydrite, limestone, salt and red beds.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The crosswell seismic data acquisition is conducted by deploying an array of receivers in one well and a source in another well (Fig. 2). The source is moved up at regular intervals, emitting a controlled pulse measured by the receiver array in the other well and then moved to the next location. The goal is to illuminate as much of the subsurface as possible through the aperture of the source locations and range of receiver locations. In a typical acquisition, both source and receivers are placed at the base of the reservoir or zone of interest.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr10">With the water zone being only a few hundred feet below the main pay, picking the correct lateral landing point is crucial to the success of a San Andres project. Further evaluation was done using data from the offset well and performing fully 3D planar simulations using various pump schedules at different depths along the lateral. The ultimate purpose was to determine the hydraulic fracture design that would cover the pay zone without growing into the water zone. Results from the fluid design sensitivity are shown in Fig.5.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr14">By using this technique, it is assumed that all perforation clusters within the same stage break down and initiate fracture simultaneously because each cluster has similar stress characteristics. The completion strategy was set at 70 ft between clusters and 3-4 clusters per stage. Rates were adjusted per stage according to the number of clusters. The results of the perforation optimization are shown in Fig. 9.</p><div id="link-10">

Monitoring covered stages 1-6 using a 12-shuttle versatile seismic imager (VSI) geophone array deployed at one vertical position of the offset well.

<p id="Ancr16">Consequently, geophysicists compute the effective stimulated volume (ESV) as a measure of MS activity. One of the main objectives behind the MS was to measure the real-time growth of the fracture to avoid its extension into the underlain water zones. With that objective in mind, a small playbook was created as part of a contingency plan to help during the operations (Fig. 11). This contingency plan enabled changing designs during the operation based on the microseismic results.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr17">While pumping the job, height growth into the water zone was observed for stages 1 and 2 (Fig. 12), and, based on the contingency plan, the design was changed from stage 3 onwards. First, the job size was reduced; then, the slickwater portion from the treatment was eliminated, and, later, the rate was reduced. After stage 6, we were not able to obtain microseismic data due to distance limitation and, the remaining job was pumped with the last modified design.</p><div id="link-13">
