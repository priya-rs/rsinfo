<p id="Ancr4">The subject reservoir is the largest and thickest reservoir having the most oil in place (OIP) in the field and extends around 35 km in the East-West direction, 20 km in the North-South direction and has an average thickness of 140 ft. The reservoir is subdivided into 6 minor sub-reservoirs (Layer A to Layer F) and stylolite layers are intercalated between sub-reservoirs. The stylolite layers are tight but not zero-permeable and the communications between sub-reservoirs are observed by the data obtained from log and dynamic testing throughout the whole field. As shown in Fig. 1, this reservoir is sectorized into five areas based on geological similarity – North East, Heterogeneous, Homogeneous, Near West and West area. The North East area is fractured and faulted, having high heterogeneity and uncertainty of geology. The Near West area is relatively tight and homogeneous.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The Heterogeneous area is permeable and heterogeneous with high-perm streaks (HKS) in the upper layers (i.e. Layer A to C). HKS have several hundred mD permeability compared with 5-20 mD matrix (non-HKS) permeability. Fig. 2 shows the HKS distribution in the reservoir with boundaries of Heterogeneous and Homogeneous area. Due to the high permeability contrast with non-HKS layers, HKS has a significant impact on the fluid behavior in the reservoir for both water injection and gas injection; hence, the assessment of this impact is a key criterion for successful miscible EOR implementation. We previously conducted a multi-year screening study to select the primary target areas for miscible EOR (Willingham et al. 2016).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">For the subject field, in the early 2000s, a series of laboratory tests including conventional and special PVT tests (e.g. slimtube test, swelling test) and conventional and special core analysis (e.g. miscible gas coreflood tests) was initiated. As a result of the laboratory test, the MMP (Minimum Miscible Pressure) for HC (hydrocarbon) gas and CO2 gas was estimated as 3750 psi and 2500 psi, respectively, by the slimtube test. Fig. 3 shows slimtube test results (plot of RF with pressure).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">EOS (Equation of State) is one of the most important input parameters for compositional simulation to replicate fluid behavior under the reservoir condition. For the subject field, the EOS had been tuned to match the laboratory test of HC gas injection but had not been tuned to match the laboratory test of CO2 injection. The MMP of CO2 estimated by slimtube test was 2570 psi but the MMP of CO2 estimated by simulation was 3770 psi, while the MMP of HC gas estimated by slimtube test was 3770 psi and the MMP of HC gas estimated by simulation was 3670 psi as shown in Fig. 4. Hence, 1D simulations replicating the slimtube test were developed and the EOS parameters were tuned to match simulation result with actual lab test results.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr8">Fig. 5 shows the plot for the pressure with recovery factor and MMP estimated from the lab test and simulation results with tuned EOS. The MMP of CO2 with tuned EOS (2880 psi) is close to the actual laboratory test result compared with pre-tuned EOS result (3770 psi). Although the MMP with tuned EOS is still not exactly matched with the lab test result (2570 psi), it deviates to the ‘conservative’ side. In the near miscible region (i.e. in the region below the calculated MMP), simulation results will be conservative, which bodes well for our predictions. The impact of EOS tuning on the MMP of HC gas was limited because only parameters related to the CO2 component were tuned and the CO2 composition in HC gas is only 3%as shown in Table 1.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">In order to understand the injected gas behavior and optimize the gas injection scheme, a simulation study using sector models was conducted. First, the impact of simulation grid size was investigated. Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 shows the impact of the grid size on the injected gas behavior and oil recovery in miscible CO2 flooding simulation. The injected gas in the fine grid model overrides more sharply relative to the coarse grid model and hence the recovery of the coarse grid model is higher than the fine grid model result (i.e. the coarse grid model overestimate the recovery). Hence, it is important to use a fine grid model to minimize the grid size effect. However, a fine grid model increases the number of total grids resulting in a significant increase of simulation run time.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr11">For the subject field, it is well known that the HKS in the upper layers have a significant impact on the behavior of water injection. Fig. 8-(a) shows an example of typical water distribution after several years of water injection. The injected water overrides towards the HKS flooding the upper layers selectively. In theory, the water in upper layers will slump due to gravity; however, in the reservoir, the water is held in the upper layers against the gravity force due to the capillary force. Fig. 8-(b) shows the capillary pressure curves of HKS layer and matrix (non-HKS) layer.</p><div id="link-8">

WAG operations with constant ratios of 4:1 (4 years water injection to 1 year gas injection), 2:1 and 1:1 were evaluated. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the impact of using various constant CO2 WAG ratios for the Heterogeneous and Homogeneous models, respectively.

<p id="Ancr19">In the first case, infill wells at 500m spacing were added at a 10% recovery factor and CO2 WAG was started at a 22% recovery factor for the "Infill First" case, while CO2 WAG was started at a 10%recovery factor prior to infill drilling to 500m at a 22% recovery factor in a "WAG First" case. The simulation results in Fig. 16 demonstrate that an "Infill First" strategy is preferred to maintain plateau because the WAG response with 500m spacing (i.e. "Infill First") is much faster than 1km spacing (i.e. "WAG First").</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr20">Fig. 17 shows the cross-sections of the CO2 mole fraction in the Tapered CO2 WAG simulation case for Heterogeneous and Homogeneous model. Gas gravity override occurred in both models but the Heterogeneous model shows more gas override in early stage due to the HKS in upper layers. This results in the faster oil recovery response and gas breakthrough in the Heterogeneous model. However, finally, both models show similar level of gas override after long time gas injection and the ultimate oil recovery uplift is also similar (8% in Heterogeneous model and 9% in Homogeneous model).</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr25">Fig. 22 shows simulation results of miscible HC gas and miscible CO2 Tapered WAG compared to water injection for the Heterogeneous Model. Hydrocarbon gas injection results in 10% OOIP incremental versus 13% for CO2. As for the Homogeneous model, miscible hydrocarbon gas injection improves recovery by 13% OOIP versus 15% for CO2 as shown in Fig. 22. The small loss in recovery using hydrocarbon gas versus CO2 will likely be acceptable given the higher costs of CO2, increased facility costs and complexity, increased costs in tubulars including metallurgy and associated work-overs, and potential loss of hydrocarbon sales due to production of CO2 along with the associated hydrocarbon gas.</p><div id="link-22">
