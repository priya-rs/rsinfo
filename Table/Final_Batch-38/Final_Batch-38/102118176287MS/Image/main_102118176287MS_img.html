<p id="Ancr1">Besides the correct understanding of seismic data, understanding of geological and petrophysical events, reservoir fluid distribution, the production profile, pressure transient testing data, PVT properties and overall reservoir fluid characterization is fundamental to establish the actual reservoir potential, both in terms of achievable reserves and production development capabilities. All of this information is not only important at the initial stages of commercial production but during the production acceleration and plateau stabilization phases as well. The North Kuwait Gas Development Project consists initially of six fields. Most of the development activity has been oriented towards Raudhatain (RA) and Sabriyah (SA) fields, mainly in the highly heterogeneous, fractured, and initially over pressurized MM formation. The structure map for the MM is shown in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">A geophysics review study was conducted as parts of the construction of the static and dynamic model for reservoirs in the Raudhatain and Sabriyah fields. The 3D seismic survey information used was a Pre-Stack Migration in Time (PSTM), reprocessed in July 2012. From the seismic section we can observe several vertical features as a "chimney" zone with chaotic and low amplitudes, which are interpreted as " gas chimneys" in the proximity of wells used in this study. This observation is depicted in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Figure 4 shows a structural cross section with the recorded formation temperature for the different wells across neighboring SA and RA fields. With the aim to confirm the abnormal temperature gradient observed in the MM formation, a second source belonging to MDT data was incorporated. Gathered MDT data also displayed on a structural cross section is depicted in Figure 5. All MDT data available in the MM formation was incorporated into the analysis, consistently showing that the highest reservoir temperature were recorded in the most shallow areas in the SA field, with temperature ranging from 275.63 to 276.99 °F, for the depth interval of 14530 and 14793 ft bsl, respectively.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The first study approach was based on diminishing temperature by increasing the depth to honor the abnormal temperature gradient in the direction of temperature reduction in order to generate different datasets of temperature dependent fluid compositions. In these data sets the reservoir temperature changes with depth considering the abnormal-inverse temperature gradient previously discussed. In Figure 6, one can observe the incremental changes in depth triggered a displacement of the critical point from the right side to the left side of the phase envelop diagram, away from the cricondentherm, until reaching a certain point in which the reservoir fluid phase behavior changes from liquid to gas condensate.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">The second study included compositional sensitivities, aimed to evaluate the effect of small variations in key fluid components and fluid thermodynamics. As depicted in Figure 7, for subsequent analyses, fractions of C1 and C7+ were slightly (Original C1= 63.7648 later modified to 61.8510; and Original C7+= 7.0752 and modified to 8.9889) modified from their original values, allowing the critical point to migrate away from the reservoir temperature line. At this point, the phase behavior changed from liquid to gas condensate.</p><div id="link-7">
