<p id="Ancr1">The geocellular and dynamic models used in the earlier SAMA EOR studies (Koyassan Veedu et al. 2015a) were updated with the available data from the new pilot wells and from new laboratory experiments. The initial location for the planned ASP pilot in the SAMA was moved approximately 1.5 km to the northwest owing to facility and operational constraints. The new pilot area is located inside an existing inverted 9-spot waterflood pattern (Figure 1). Several of the five pilot wells have been drilled and cored.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The development of the sector geocellular model is described in Koyassan Veedu et. al. (2015a).Inthe current study, we updated the geocellular model with well log and core data available from the new pilot wells. The geocellular model update followed a standard workflow that included stratigraphic modeling, structural modeling, property distribution based on petrophysical rock types and volume estimates. The updated sector geocellular model was scaled up using a flow-based algorithm with layer combinations such that the fine-scale pressure profile is preserved. Figure 2 shows a fence diagram that compares the scaled-up and fine-scale porosity distribution and layer thickness.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The initial sector simulation model was too large and coarse to properly model the 4.9 acre interwell ASP pilot, and also included layers not to be targeted during the pilot. Therefore, we developed a smaller sector extracted from the history-matched sector model.

The pilot simulation model only included zones from MaB-MaE (Figure 11) as they are the most promising EOR targets based on inspection of zone properties and earlier simulations reported by Koyassan Veedu et al.

<p id="Ancr10">Preliminary evaluation shows that certain layers of the Mauddud formation are more promising for ASP flooding than others. For example Layers MaA and MaF produce and receive very little fluid based on PLT studies across the field (Koyassan Veedu et al., 2015a, Figure 10). Figure 11 shows the core-derived permeability distribution between wells. The data clearly show that layers below the shaly barrier are lower quality than the layers above it, especially in terms of permeability.</p><div id="link-10">

These high rates enable the pilot to be completed in a short time, and may be optimistic from an implementation perspective. Water was injected in each well for 30 days before tracer was injected. Subsequent simulations showed that reservoir sweep is relatively insensitive to the time at which tracer test is started. The volume swept by water and by ASP fluids was calculated for each injector/producer pair as shown in Figure 14.</p><div id="link-14">

Also, the more viscous fluids counteract heterogeneity so the difference in the sweep efficiency between the four injectors and the producer is less than for the waterflood.

The peak surfactant concentration is about 40% of its injected value due to dispersion and retention. An oil bank forms with a peak oil cut of about 63%. ASP incremental oil recovery is predicted to be substantial – on the order of 50% of OOIP - due to both increased volumetric sweep and low residual saturation in the swept zone.</p><div id="link-17">

These results are in good agreement with earlier simulations using the Sector Simulation Model by Koyassan Veedu et al. 2015, which suggests final oil saturation of 52% after extended waterflood, and below 28% in the ASP pilot. The ASP simulations reported by Koyassan Veedu et al. ended after less injection volume than those presented here but were still producing substantial oil at the final timestep, meaning the true agreement is likely even better.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr21">Decreasing the producer rate limit to 3,000 bbls/day could have substantial negative impacts on the pilot – ASP fluids which would otherwise usefully sweep the target volume are being diverted outside the target volume and total oil recovery suffers as a result (Figure 21). This effect would be even more significant if the oil bank mobility is underestimated, making it more difficult to produce. However, all effects of well injectivity and production will depend on to-be-determined by real world productivity which will updated in the model after completion of the waterflood.</p><div id="link-21">
