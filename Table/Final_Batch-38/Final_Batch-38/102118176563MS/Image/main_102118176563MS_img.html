<p id="Ancr4">The field was discovered in 2000, where the first exploration well discovered a massive stratigraphic feature: from the Middle Jurassic up to Paleoigene deposits. It is an oil-gas-condensate, thin oil rim clastic reservoir with an average thickness of 20 metres, bounded by a massive gas cap approximately 100 metres in height and an underlying active aquifer shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">To mitigate gas coning, it was expected that PICD could be used to balance inflow and choke gas upon breakthrough but did not sufficiently choke gas inflow. Even with a low drawdown (between 3 to 6 bars), the GOR steadily increases with no sign of abating as illustrated in Figure 6. Some PICD wells have a producing GOR of 2500 m3/m3, which is almost 25 times more than the design GOR.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">With this constraint in mind, it is only possible by moving the drilling portal to the stern and freeing two rows of slots on the spider desk as shown in Figure 7 and setting up an upper roller for the lubricator requires the use of a deck crane. Therefore, this creates additional complications for scheduling loading operations between escort vessels and the platform. For these reasons, PLTs were ruled out as an unfeasible and complicated monitoring option.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">The inflow tracer systems are unique tracer molecules embedded in a polymer matrix material, in the shape of rods as shown in Figure 9. This combination is classified as a tracer system. Water tracer systems are designed to release tracer material to water and oil tracer systems are designed to release tracer material to oil. The tracer release rate is independent of fluid velocity passing the polymer matrix; release changes with the degree of target fluid contact called wetting. Both oil and water tracer systems are dormant when not in contact with their target phase. This also means if a gaseous phase is in contact with either oil or water tracer systems, no tracers will be released at all. The absence of tracer from a particular location can also indicate there is no flow, meaning no wetting from a target fluid.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">The LWD log interpretation indicated the thickness of the Middle Neocom lessened eastwards and changed by ~5 metres in the drilling interval of 2020 –2110 metre and by ~1 metre between 5800 – 6120 metre interval. The reservoir is characterized by a high degree of heterogeneity and is complicated by lens-like inclusions of dense carbonized sandstone. Outside the dome of the reservoir, the reservoir properties reduce in quality, the oil saturated sandstone became increasingly interbedded by carbonized rocks. The final well placement interpretation can be seen in Figure 10.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">The pilot well was drilled and completed on the 15th of October, 2014, sixteen compartments were isolated with swell packers in the open hole annulus. It is important to note that the tracers are only indicative of flow between packers. After the LWD logs were interpreted, the asset team identified where to place the swell packers and the eight chemical sensors in the lower completion, meaning the other eight remaining zones are unmonitored or without sensors and therefore termed as “blind zones”. The chemical sensor placement strategy was to position each sensor in separate completion compartments which had good quality sands and stay approximately 5 metres above the OWC. In addition, the blind zones adjacent to the monitored zones were also placed near sands of similar sand quality. The final placement of the eight chemical sensors along the horizontal producing interval is illustrated in Figure 11 and Figure 12.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr19">The basis for this model relies on the rate of change of the back produced released tracer molecules, which is dependent on the flow rate past the respective chemical sensor. For instance, in a high permeability production interval, a high tracer concentration response will be observed to rapidly decline towards steady-state or a near constant level. From a section with comparably lower permeability, a slower rate of decline is observed. This principle is illustrated in Figure 17.</p><div id="link-17">
