Apply Darcy's Law to determine the velocity field for the underlying (static) grid and trace streamlines (Figure 1, left). Streamlines are assumed to be constant over Δti. Note that this is identical to the "Implicit Pressure" step in the traditional IMPES simulation approach.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The model is initialized at a critical water saturation, Swc=0, which along with a non-uniform porosity distribution, gives the initial oil in place map shown in Figure 2 left. Areal permeability is also assumed to vary spatially. Next we run the model under a traditional streamline-based IMPES flow simulation and generate synthetic production and injection profiles for each well, as summarized for the field in Figure 2 bottom. Also included for reference is the flux-pattern map (FPMap) showing the well locations and producer-centered well rate allocation factors (Figure 2 right) at 10 days.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Figure 3 shows the water saturation maps that result from the two computation methods. The saturations as derived from a classic streamline-based flow simulation are shown in the top row; the saturations computed from PatMB are shown in the bottom row. The top row flow simulation results show the expected growth of the injected water as time increases (10, 20, 60 days). The bottom row of images is for the same timesteps and is the effective saturation (from Eq. 3) by applying material balance to the well-pair CVs and the synthetic historical injection/production rates (not shown) for each well. The TOF cutoff ensures that the material balance saturation is only applied to a portion of the bundle volume between each well-pair, which is why the saturation front appears to grow as time increases.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Shown in Figure 4 is a comparison between flow simulation (top row) and PatMB (bottom row) for the final timestep after 1 PVI. The left column images show the oil saturation, while the right column images show the Remaining Oil volume In Place (ROIP) distribution. In comparing the final oil saturations, there are clear differences between the two methods in that the PatMB approach lacks the gridcell-level detail of the flow simulation. However both methods show the trend of higher oil saturations on the west side of the model along with some unswept regions. Comparing the ROIP maps (right column) again reveals differences, but the unswept spots of high ROIP (red areas) are apparent in both methods.</p><div id="link-4">
