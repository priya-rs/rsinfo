<p id="Ancr1">The lithology is anhydritic dolomite with interbedded eolian siltstones and fine-grained sandstones. The facies range from anhydrite-dominated sabkha dolomites to protected tidal flats and shallow lagoons behind ramp crest bars. Inner-to-middle ramp deposits are dominated by heavily bioturbated packstones and wackestones, with minor mudstones. The ramp crest is higher-energy peloidal and grain-dominated packstones and grainstones (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The Yeso Formation has four members, the Paddock, Blinebry, Tubb and Drinkard Members, and is overlain by the Glorieta Formation (Fig. 2). The Glorieta is a sandstone with interbedded dolomites, while the Paddock and Blinebry are predominantly dolomitic with some interbedded siltstones. The Tubb, below the Blinebry, is silt and sand dominated, and the Drinkard ranges from dolomites to siltstones. Production is often from subtle anticlines, but it is also strongly controlled by stratigraphic facies changes.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Occidental Petroleum has drilled more than 80 vertical wells, targeting the Paddock and the Blinebry formations of the Yeso, over the past 6 years in the North West Shelf in the North New Mexico area. Most of the wells were drilled consecutively and were completed with similar fracturing designs. The wells showed severe scaling problems, mainly gypsum and anhydrite (CaSO4) from the beginning of their production and therefore they were required to be on constant chemical treatment ever since. Fig. 3 illustrates the rigorousness of the scale that is encountered in at least three different wells in the area.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The new approach that was implemented began with the better understanding of the reservoir quality in the area where the majority of the company’s activity was. To prove the new concept the wells that are located in the better reservoir quality and exhibited low productivity profiles were selected first. In order to be able to accomplish that a hydrocarbon pore volume map (Fig. 4) was generated for the area using all the available log and core data that was gathered in the early stages of the lives of these wells.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The first step towards forming a suitable chemical treatment is to properly identify the types of scale existing in the wellbore. In order to be able to do that, several water samples from most of the wells were collected and analyzed for scale. The results were similar for the majority of the wells and a typical water analysis table is presented in Fig. 5 that follows. The downhole temperature (mid perforation temperature observed in the wells is close to 99 °F) is correlated to the amount of scale in pounds per thousand barrels (ptb), found in the sample. To gauge the severity of the amount, a scaling index threat chart is used (Fig. 6).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The well was treated and acidized through the backside of the tubing. Fig. 7 below shows the production profile of the well, where the allocated (sales volumes) and well test rates for all the fluids are shown. Based on that, the well has been experiencing a lot of scale and paraffin problems from the beginning of its life. The periods that show no production have to do with pump issues created mainly from the accumulated downhole scale. Notice the erratic production that the well exhibits throughout its history before the new treatment was applied.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">This well was shut-in due to operational issues and a pump failure. The proposed treatment was deployed using the tubing and packer method. The packer was set right above each perforated stage and and the treatment was spotted through the tubing. The results of the acid job, presented in Fig 8 below, show a well performance increase of 360% (incremental oil production), while the well has produced an additional cumulative oil of 3.1 MBO for 6 months.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">The studied well was treated using the most expensive but yet effiecient method, where a retrievable bridge plug is utilized to seal the bottom of each treatment and ensure the efficiency of it for all the stages. In this case, each formation was isolated and tested separately to observe its contribution to the production of the well. The Blinebry was acidized first and tested for a few months yielding an incremental oil rate of 50%(Fig. 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The proposed treatment and pumping techniques have been succesfully applied in more than 20 wells producing from the Yeso formation. The treated wells were selected based on the reservoir quality to firstly prove the concept and secondly maximize the returns. Fig. 10 shows an ascending "total" and a 90-day" incremental cumulative oil production for 20 wells, along with their location in the hydrocarbon pore volume map. The wells were picked from across the field and areas with different reservoir quality.</p><div id="link-10">
