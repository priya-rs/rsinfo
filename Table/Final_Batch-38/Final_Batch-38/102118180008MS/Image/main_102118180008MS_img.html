<p id="Ancr5">Data uploads are performed by mobilizing a portable surface transceiver package on a supply boat or equivalent vessel. The boat positions itself overhead the well location and a dunking transducer is then deployed over the side of the vessel to a depth of approximately 10 to 15 m below sea level (see Fig. 3). An acoustic signal is then transmitted from surface to the subsea receiver, requesting the data stored in memory to be transmitted to surface. Once data communications have been established with the subsea receiver, the data upload process typically takes 2 to 3 hours to complete.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">To streamline the offshore rig-up and deployment process, the EM gauge equipment was pre-assembled onshore in Stavanger and shipped to the rig in a near ready-to-go state. The long term gauges were mounted on 2 7/8_ tubing, the relay stations on 4 ½” tubing and the memory logging tool on 3 ½” tubing. Fig. 6 shows the pre-assembled long term gauges in a completion basket ready for shipment to the rig.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The EM topside receiver was commissioned on 20th July 2013 and data was successfully received from each of the three below-packer long term EM gauges. To confirm data quality and repeatability, the EM gauge data was compared with the data being received from the standard DST surface readout gauges and excellent agreement was observed as can be seen in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">With the DST string recovered from the well and the well plug and abandonment process underway, the EM subsea receiver equipment was made ready for deployment. Two EM receivers with acoustic data loggers and wet mate connectors were pre-installed on the anti-trawl frame. The anti-trawl frame was then deployed to the seabed on 5 ½” drill pipe (see Fig. 8) with an ROV used to oversee and confirm correct landing of the frame on to the wellhead. Once all connections were confirmed as good the ROV folded down the sides of the anti-trawl frame to lie on the sea bed.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr13">A diagnostic plot comprising log-log and pressure derivative curves was made using the EM gauge data and this can be seen in Fig.11. Analysis of the data identified two no-flow boundaries some 130 m and 280 m from the wellbore that were not observed during the normal DST period. The distance between the flow barriers is much smaller than the ca. 1.5 km width of the seismic channel and therefore it was concluded that the large seismic channel most likely comprises a channel belt with individual smaller channels and having internal flow barriers within the channel belt.</p><div id="link-11">
