<p id="Ancr1">The Golfo San Jorge (GSJ) mature basin is located in southern Argentina, in the central part of Patagonia (Fig. 1). It represents about 50% of Argentina's daily oil production and holds two-thirds of its oil reserves (Palacios 2017). The GSJ basin was discovered in 1907 and was the first developed oil basin in the country. It spreads over an approximate area of 200,000 km2 onshore and offshore, from which 70,000 km2 are considered to include potentially productive reservoirs.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Structural features subdivide the basin into three areas known as Faja Plegada (folded belt) to the west and Flanco Norte (north flank) and Flanco Sur (south flank) to the east. In this contribution, we will focus on the south flank fields and reservoirs, located in the Santa Cruz province. Fig. 2 shows the generalized stratigraphic column for the basin, with the commonly used names for the formations in the area involved in this study. The main producing zones are in the Chubut group: Bajo Barreal, Castillo, and Pozo D-129 formations (Hechem and Strelkov 2002).</p><div id="link-2">

The large tool was logged in 2016, and the slim tool was logged in 2017, almost a year later for comparison and validation of the processing scheme and results. The slim tool is equipped with smaller detectors, and we noticed that some elements that are more difficult to measure in the capture spectra, such as Al and Na, were too statistical (noisy). The solution adopted was to redistribute these elements in the initial spectral stripping and emulate them with a multilinear regression using the other elements and sigma. The regressions were developed using OH and CH high-quality data from the large PNL tool.</p><div id="link-4">

Also, the fluid segregation is evident from the C/O quadrilateral plot on the right-hand side of Fig. 8, giving an apparent 40% oil holdup indication. The borehole carbon had to be removed before proceeding with the analysis and interpretation.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">This well could not be logged in OH, and at the time the well was completed in 2015, a simple sigma log was recorded for correlation purposes. Tracks 1 and 2 in Fig. 9 show the pseudo-SP and pseudo-resistivity logs produced at that time, which are basically rescaled versions of the sigma curve. Based on these pseudo-logs, the perforation intervals shown in the well sketch track were selected; these were essentially all the intervals where the pseudo Rt goes above a given cutoff.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">A similar plot is shown for well D in Fig. 11 for the deeper Castillo formation this time. In this, the neutron porosity was acquired with a legacy slim PNL tool, a thermal decay porosity (neutron-gamma porosity). Once again, there was good correlation between the mud shows and TOC, and the selected interval at X038–X044 m produced 300 B/D oil and gas, flowing naturally with the reservoir energy. Notice that below X050 m, there are several intervals with similar sigma reading, apparent high pseudo Rt, but with much less or no TOC and modest or no gas shows. This confirms that the pseudo logs, or any type of analysis based only on a basic sigma log, can be used for correlation purposes, but cannot determine conclusively productive intervals.</p><div id="link-11">

The crossover FNXS-TPHI is only qualitative because the scales had been arbitrarily selected to emulate an OH density-neutron track display, but helps to flag possible gas zones.</p><div id="link-13">
