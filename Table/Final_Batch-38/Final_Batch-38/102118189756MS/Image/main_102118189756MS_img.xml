<anchoringText id="Ancr3">The A0201 SAP pilot was a single well pair (A01) pilot in the A02 pad of the Christina Lake Thermal Project (CLTP). A map showing the location of the A0201 well pair relative to the neighboring well pairs and pads is shown in Figure 1. The A0201 well pair is drilled 200 meters south of the A0202 well pair which has been on a butane SAP since 2009. The lateral extent of the A0202 chamber is expected to be quite wide and large. The chambers of the two well pairs are expected to be merged by the end of 2017. The geostatistical profile of A0201 well created at the time of drilling is shown in Figure 2.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">The presence of the shale barrier is confirmed by a high gamma ray reading in the producer well log. Figure 7 shows the vertical permeability of the simulation model, with the shale barrier identified with very low porosity and permeability in the simulation model. The exact size, porosity and permeability of this shale barrier are unknown; it was found though that in simulation the production performance of the well pair is greatly affected by the size and permeability of the shale barrier.</anchoringText>

Figure 10 shows the produced oil rates are most impacted by the injected solvent viscosity and solubility, as expected.
