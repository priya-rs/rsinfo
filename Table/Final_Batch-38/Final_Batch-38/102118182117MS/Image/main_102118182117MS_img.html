<p id="Ancr1">The Salym group of fields is located in Khanty-Mansi autonomous district of the Russian Federation (Fig. 1). The deposits are at an advanced stage of development and require measures to increase oil recovery and reduce water production. The primary development is the Cherkashinskaya suite, which includes oil-saturated reservoirs AS11.1, AS11.2 and AS11.3. Well was perforated in intervals of AS11.2, and AS11.3 reservoirs (Fig. 2). A complicating factor for hydraulic fracturing in these formations is the proximity of a thick and highly permeable aquifer AS10 (Fig. 2), which, if penetrated by a hydraulic fracture, can lead to a significant increase in fluid rate and water production, and the expected increase in oil production might not be realized. This creates an additional load on the oil treatment facility. In this case, correct simulation and fracturing without penetrating highly permeable aquifers is important. Modern software simulators model fracture geometry correctly but require calibration and validation by various methods.</p><div id="link-1">

The well was drilled and put into production in January 2009. Two water injection wells (from the east and west sides) were also drilled for pressure support purposes, with water injection starting in January 2009. Before fracturing, the treatment fluid rate was 112 m3/day, and the water cut was 92%; the high water content resulted from injection water breakthrough from the injection wells (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">Before the major fracturing treatment, testing was performed using a minifrac (Fig. 9) to assess the treatment parameters. During the minifrac, sand (1 ton of 100-mesh) and proppant (3 tons of NRT 16/20-mesh) was pumped to clean the perforation zone. Analysis of the minifrac showed a fluid efficiency of 27%and final bottomhole shut-in pressure of 318 bar, which corresponded to the shut-in gradient of 0.138 bar/m. </p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The net pressure was 34 bar. After analyzing the minifrac, the decision was made to perform the main fracturing treatment per the initial design. During the main fracturing stage (Fig. 10), a buffer of 24 m3 (24.3%) of crosslinked 30-lbm gel and 36 tons of NRT proppant (16.5 tons of 16/20-mesh and 19.5 tons of 12/18-mesh) was pumped. The maximum proppant concentration was 1,000 kg/m3, while more than half of the proppant was pumped at greater than 800 kg/m3. The job was pumped as per design which also implied zero underflush volume for temperature logging immediately after the primary treatment.</p><div id="link-10">

In this method, as in acoustic logging, differential characteristics (measured between the proximal and the distal detectors) are less sensitive than the integral ones (measured at the large transmitter/proximal Detector 1, transmitter/distal detector base). Moreover, TRNP hydrogen content is less sensitive than the sigma capture</p><div id="link-13">

Using the adjusted values of Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio in simulation (Fig. 5) changed the geometry of the hydraulic fracture. A comparison of pressures in the F3D simulator showed the fracture breakthrough into the aquifer (Fig. 15). Tellingly, the fracture did not develop in the entire water-bearing interval and was limited to the middle of the highly permeable formation. This kind of fracture growth resulted from the different geomechanical properties of rocks in the upper and lower parts of the water-saturated horizon.

The difference between the total height of the fracture and the height filled with proppant was approximately 2 m, indicating agreement. It can be assumed that the acoustic method also registers the hydraulic fracture where rock discontinuity was created, but proppant did not secure this part of it. It is possible that the proppant secured the edges of the fracture, but its concentration was so small that it was not registered by DBTDT.</p><div id="link-16">
