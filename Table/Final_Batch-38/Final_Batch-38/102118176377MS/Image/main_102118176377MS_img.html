<p id="Ancr1">The onshore Burgan field is the world’s second largest oil field, situated in the desert of southeastern Kuwait as shown on Fig. 1. The prolific reservoir, discovered in 1938, produces approximately half Kuwait’s oil. In 2014, the operator assigned high focus on exploration and development of Burgan field to maintain production rates and explore potential geological pay zones.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">In Well 5, PDC bits are a durable solution to drill the entire section using one bit. However, high vibrations are expected by drilling with a PDC, either on rotary drive or mud motor. The torque range required to drill with a PDC is higher than that for a roller cone bit. Large diameter PDC bits tend to generate high drilling vibrations and stabilizing the BHA becomes increasingly challenging. Fig. 6 Shows plotted results for torque ranges and fluctuations in a drilling simulation lab. The experiment conducted illustrates that when drilling through inter-bedded formations, at constant WOB and RPM, Torque fluctuations are a function of bit type. Roller cone tend to provide the least torque fluctuations in comparison to PDC and hybrid bits, as per the simulation lab results.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The 22 inch hybrid bit achieved 30.7 ft./hr., total average ROP, increasing ROP by 142% from offsets average performance at 13 ft./hr. The drilling days chart on Fig. 9 summarizes the 22 inch section performances in Well 5 and offset wells. The gradient of the curves indicates ROP, since it’s depth over time. The steepest slope is the one for Well 5, indicating the highest ROP. Despite the fact that ROP was controlled and drilling parameters were minimized from depth 5,543 to 5,950 ft., due to fluid losses in porous formation layers.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">In Well 5, drilling parameters have been real-time monitored and recorded at half hour frequency intervals. Fig 11 illustrates the footage based trend of WOB, RPM, flow rate, torque in contrast with instantaneous ROP. The vertical dotted lines distinguish the three bit runs. The chart illustrates the direct relationship of WOB to ROP; the downward trend line of WOB towards run 2 and 3 is reflected by ROP downward trend.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">Overall bit condition is rated ‘good’, given the PDC cutters have minor wear due to the presence of sandstone. Total of four cutters, in different locations on the blades, have impact damage. This is related to drilling in inter-bedded formation layers. The bit was measured to be at full diameter. The cones’ bearing were inspected and graded as ‘effective’. Given that total revolutions recorded were 600 thousand revolutions. The cone inserts have minor wear around the outer cutting structure. Additionally, the nozzles are not plugged and the depth-of-cut limiters have minimal uniform wear as shown on Fig. 13.</p><div id="link-13">
