<div id="102118181721MS-tblwrp-1" content-type="structured"><p>In 2014, there were minimal changes made to the completion frac design. Table 1 shows the typical frac design parameters. The most notable change was the reduction from 75% of stage fluid volume consisting of linear gel-based frac fluid to only 15% of stage fluid volume being linear gel-based. This change not only resulted in reduced frac water usage and lower completion costs, but it also increased the operator's ability to fracture numerous intervals that were too difficult to frac using the previous design.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> Fracturing Design Parameters for Sections I, II &amp; III</p><p>Table 1 Fracturing Design Parameters for Sections I, II &amp; III</p><table id="102118181721MS-Tbl_SPi-1" frame="hsides">
