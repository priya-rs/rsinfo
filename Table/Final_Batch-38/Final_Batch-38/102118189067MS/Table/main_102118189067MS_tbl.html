Consistently, these measurements prove that most of the gas is produced from R4 reservoir. Such observation confirms the necessity for the natural gas lift method, as it indicates that the percentage of associated gas produced from the deeper reservoir is not enough to help lift the column of fluid.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> Comparison between the results of the PVT analysis on Well A and the result given by the production logging measurement</p><p>Table 1 Comparison between the results of the PVT analysis on Well A and the result given by the production logging measurement</p><table id="102118189067MS-Tbl_SPi-1" frame="hsides">
