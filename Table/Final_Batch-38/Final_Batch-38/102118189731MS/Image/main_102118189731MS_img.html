<p id="Ancr8">Early infill drilling programs increased total well count to 153 (vs. 81 planned), with an average well spacing of 200250m (10-15 acres/well) in the oil column, but production (Figure 6) remained below targeted levels. Field performance continued to surprise on the downside, and modeling remained a significant challenge as regular model updates with numerous local modifications were required to achieve ‘history matches’. This suggested a fundamental issue with the flow dynamics in the reservoir as compared to the model.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">With time, it became apparent that water movement was more widespread than could be explained by discrete, scattered high permeability streaks. A key indicator of more diffuse/widespread water movement came from saturation monitoring logs (Figure 8) in a few wells, which showed increased Sw in most sands; in contrast with a reservoir model populated with a few high permeability streaks. Selective flow tests in several wells further bolstered these observations.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr11">Figure 9 shows Bhagyam MDT data overlaid on the core poro-perm plot. On the right side of the plot, early oil-leg MDT data are shown in red, with later water-leg points in yellow. A startling trend emerges: water-leg points correlate nicely with core data while oil-leg points are substantially lower (by up to an order of magnitude). Obviously, there is something impacting in situ permeability estimates from the oil column but not from the (single-phase) aquifer zone.</p><div id="link-9">
