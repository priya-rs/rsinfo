<p id="Ancr1">BHP Billiton’s Greater Angostura field discovered in 1999 is located in Block 2 (c) 25 miles from the coast of Trinidad and Tobago. The field was developed in 3 phases: Phase 1, which includes the Kairi, Canteen and Horsts fields; Phase 2, which includes the Aripo gas development; and Phase 3 which is scheduled to be completed by the second half of 2016. A top structure map of the Greater Angostura Field highlighting the development phases is shown in Fig. 1</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">When the well models are combined with the network model, the result is a robust integrated model capable of capturing the physical response of multiphase flow behavior in the entire production system. The predicted system results can be compared to actual real-time measurements at specific locations. The model is controlled using a specific boundary condition for the operating pressure of each gathering system, i.e., HP and HGOR pressure. The production model of the Angostura field is shown in Fig. 2 to 5.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The application improves production surveillance capabilities as potential issues can be identified more readily. A graphical user interface –as shown in the example in Fig. 6– was developed to display the parameters calculated by the production model as well as the values retrieved from the real-time data acquisition system. Discrepancies between model-calculated and actual parameters alert the engineer to focus on a specific area of the system when performing the necessary diagnostics.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Using the virtual metering application and the new allocation methodology, greater confidence was built around the production rates of the wells – K-2 wells in particular. This led to the identification of the net field impact of switching the K-2 well from the HGOR to HP system. The effect on the field’s oil production from this optimization is shown in Fig. 10</p><div id="link-10">
