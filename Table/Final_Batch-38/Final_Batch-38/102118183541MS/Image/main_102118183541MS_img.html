<p id="Ancr2">The name of ‘Ghail Formation' comes from the type locality ‘Wadi Ghail' where the formation is approximately 500 m thick (Maurer et al., 2008). The Ghail Formation belongs to the Permian-Triassic Ruus al Jibal Group (RAJ), which overlies the Hagil Formation and is overlain by the Milaha Formation (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Packstone-wackestone texture is common in the "transition" zone between massive beds and laminated beds. This lithofacies has texture varying from mud-dominated peloidal packstone to wackstone (Figure 4). Both textures can be observed in different parts of the same thin section. The grain types include small benthic foraminifers, bioclasts including bivalves, gastropods, echinoderms, green algae, coated grains and peloids.

<p id="Ancr13">This type of dolomite represents the replacement of matrix. The dolomite crystals are tightly packed, with some crystal-face junctions preserved (Figure 12). The dolomite has more cloudy-cores, which could be caused by non-mimic replacement of allochems, or the presence of inclusions. Most of the original textures are not preserved. Though, some ghosts of allochems can be identified in thin section. It is more common in the massive beds.</p><div id="link-12">

It is characterized by ‘drusy dolomite', where the crystal size increases from the rim toward the center of voids. Most dolomite crystals are subhedral to anhedral with many crystal-face junctions and straight, compromise boundaries. From the different size of the crystals, it indicates different generations of dolomite cement have occurred.</p><div id="link-14">
