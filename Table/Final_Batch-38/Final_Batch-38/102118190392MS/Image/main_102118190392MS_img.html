<p id="Ancr2">In Sultanate of Oman, the ASP process was evaluated in a small (75m × 75m or 1.4 acres) inverted 5-spot pattern schematically shown in Figure 1. The pilot target location was chosen based on the reservoir properties of Well A, accessibility from existing roads and being close to the field water treatment plant (Finol et al, 2012). The target zone for the pilot was a fairly homogenous sand pack of some 20 meters thickness confined by two permeability barriers in Well A. While drilling the new pilot wells, the top of the target sand was found at the expected depth in the Injector, in the observation well OBS1, in Well B, and Well C. In the sampling well (OBS2) and Well D, however, the formation top was encountered around 15 meters deeper due to a sub-seismic fault (Al-Shuaili et al., 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The ASP formulation to a large extent drives the requirements for the facilities. The injection facilities are schematically shown in Figure 2. The source water for injection during the pilot is produced water that is also used for polymer injection in the field (Al-Saadi et al., 2012). The water needs to be softened due to alkali required in the formulation. To protect the resin used in the water softening unit the oil content of the produced water needs to be reduced to less than 5 ppm. The ASP mixing skid has two storage tanks for surfactant, one tank for co-solvent, a silo for sodium carbonate, and a silo for polymer. To facilitate dosing the solid sodium carbonate is mixed in a vessel with treated brine to produce a high strength solution. Similarly, the polymer is mixed with brine using a Polymer Slicing Unit (PSU) to obtain a polymer mother solution that is hydrated in a maturation tank.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The production of all pilot producers was routed to a purpose-built production facility to avoid any contamination of the field's production facilities with any produced chemicals. Within the pilot production facility, the full production streams from individual producers could be tested on a "flow-loop" to establish the impact of the produced chemicals on the produced oil and water quality. The flow-loop consisted of typical technologies used to process heavy oils in PDO (oil heaters, separators) and a bulk fluid heater and an electrostatic desalter in case better crude dehydration was required. The flow-loop was designed to operate with demulsifier injection at the inlet and was equipment with sampling points throughout the flow-loop to collect samples to evaluate the separation effectiveness and composition of separated fluids. The line-up of the flowloop is shown in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">ASP mixing and injection was started in February 2016. Figure 4 illustrates the injection performance in terms of rate, wellhead pressure and fluid composition for the entire ASP injection period. Injection was started at a low rate and with a low ASP viscosity. Rate and viscosity were ramped up to the design injection rate and viscosity in couple of days. However significant fluctuations in the delivered injection composition were, encountered during first two weeks of injection while the injection plant operated at design injection rate. The composition fluctuations resulted in big fluctuations in the injected ASP solution: viscosities almost doubled when the sodium carbonate addition failed and was reduced to water viscosity while there were issues with the polymer addition. To overcome these problems and to ensure a stable 50cP ASP slug, the injection rate was reduced to 66% of the design rate.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Figure 5 illustrates the injection performance with an extended time frame that includes the entire polymer chase injection. The injection rate was slowly increased back to design rate during April while the rates of the producers were also increased to balance the pilot pressure. The polymer chase was injected until early August. By that time around 0.9 PV of polymer solution with average viscosity of 50 cP were injected. The injection pressure continued to rise from 1000 kPa at the end of the ASP slug and stabilized around 2000 kPa by the end of April. When the pilot pattern was shut-in for surveillance operations in May, the injector wellhead pressure stabilized around 400 kPa. When injection was resumed, the wellhead pressures stabilize at around 1750 kPa for the remainder of the polymer chase. The injection pressure went back to zero kPa almost immediately after switching from the polymer chase to water injection in the middle of August.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">A total of 16 time-lapse surveys, intended to capture the increase in oil saturation due to the formation of an oil bank and subsequent decreases in oil saturation due to desaturation by ASP, were run during the chemical injection and displacement between February and November 2016. After the start of the ASP injection, an oil bank and the subsequent desaturation by ASP could indeed be interpreted based on the differences between subsequent NMR logs (Figure 6). The grey bars in the figure represent the positions of the conducting casing couplings that prevented the saturation interpretation at those locations. Guntupalli et al.

<p id="Ancr8">All pilot producers performed well throughout the pilot period. No failures or catastrophic events requiring unplanned interventions or workovers were encountered. The oil response in each of the producers due to ASP injection is illustrated in Figure 7 by means of the individual MPFM based water cut results of each producer during pilot operation. Water cut reversals were observed in all four producers at different levels depending on the connectivity between the producers and the central injector. Well-B and Well-C almost show text book responses due to ASP injection: a very clear decrease in water cut is observed, followed by a plateau period and finally an increase in water cut to values above 90%. Most of the produced oil during the chemical injection period came from these two wells.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The gross production and oil rate of Well B normalized by the maximum gross rate observed during the pilot operation is shown in Figure 8. The gross rate was reduced at the end of February to maintain the pressure in the pilot area while the ASP injection rate was reduced. The rate was increased by the end of April when the polymer injection rate was returned to the design rate. Normalized production profiles for the carbonate concentration and surfactant concentration are also shown together with the oil rate in Figure 8 to illustrate the chemicals break through and to show the shape of the produced chemical concentration profiles.</p><div id="link-8">

The pattern based water cut was around 85% before the start of ASP injection. The minimum water cut reached in May due to the injection of ASP was 68%. Between May and September, the BSW steadily increased as the oil rate slowly decreased and returned to values similar to those observed prior to ASP injection. The reduction in off-take during the ASP injection at reduced rate is clearly visible while the oil rate during the same period appears to increase.</p><div id="link-9">

During the pre-ASP water injection phase, reasonably good vertical conformance was observed. Slightly worse vertical conformance was seen during polymer chase phase (May 2016) when most of the injection fluid went into the middle 13 meters out of the 23 meters pay. None of the profiles collected over time showed indications of fractures breaching the barriers while the noise log acquired during polymer injection also indicated that injection was under matrix conditions.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">The Pressure Fall Off (PFO) tests during waterflood demonstrated development of skin in the injector that is consistent with the observed drop in injectivity index. The PFO also inferred that faults within the pattern are not sealing (Figure 11). PFO during polymer chase confirmed the matrix injection condition as interpreted from the PLT and the noise log. It showed the change in mobility due to viscous ASP/Polymer solutions. The near wellbore skin factor became negative. The previous PFOs during waterflood showed the positive skins. This indicates that ASP slug efficiently cleaned the well bore and displaced oil away from well bore due to its high displacement efficiency.</p><div id="link-11">

The most challenging conditions for separation observed during this period were a surfactant concentration of 100 ppm, a water phase pH of 9.3, and a water viscosity of 15cP due to produced polymer. Again, during this period, the standard demulsifier was used. Typical samples representative for this regime are shown in Figure 13; again, the left two bottles show water and oil outlet samples from the (test) separator and the right two bottles contain water and oil samples collected at the outlet of the (electrostatic) desalter.

Typical samples representing relatively good separation with the increased surfactant levels are shown in Figure 14: the left hand sample shows a sample from the water phase outlet of the separator, the middle is a water phase outlet sample from the desalter and the right hand bottle is a sample collected at the oil-phase outlet of the electrostatic desalter. Also under these conditions with added surfactant (pH 9.3, a water phase viscosity of 10cP, and a maximum surfactant concentration of 400 ppm) the water in oil content stayed at an acceptable level between 1-2%. Both water phase bottles, however, illustrate that a lot of oil remained in the water phase: with these higher surfactant concentrations the OIW could not be reduced below 1%.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr16">Shuailli et al. (2016) described the static geological models and dynamic models that were developed for the pilot area and illustrated that one of those models could reproduce both the oil production during water injection and the waterflood tracer responses reasonably well. The response due to water instead of ASP was obtained by using the actual ASP and polymer injection rates for water and by using the gross rate for the producers. For the DCA response the established field wide decline rate was used. Results of both approaches are shown in Figure 15 together with the actual pilot oil production response. Both approaches provide significant incremental volume estimates with the dynamic approach providing the largest volume estimate.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr17">Shuailli et al.'s (2016) model that reproduced the oil production during water injection, was taken forward with the "effective" ASP functionality enabled. Numerous runs with different parameter settings were made. However, a parameter set that consistently reproduces all collected data has not been obtained to date. The match at pilot level for oil rate and water cut as shown in Figure 16 is quite good. The picture for the individual producers, however, is slightly different: for Well B, too much oil is predicted, consequently for Well A and C less oil is predicted. One of the complications for this pilot is the fact that Well A is completed in two horizons.</p><div id="link-16">
