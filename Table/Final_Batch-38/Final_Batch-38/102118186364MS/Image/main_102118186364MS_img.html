<p id="Ancr1">This study is executed within complex clastic reservoir deposited in Jurassic period in Xinjiang oilfield, which is located in the Junggar Basin, northwest of China (Figure 1). The sedimentary environment is represented by braided river todeltadeposits (Xin et al., 2014, and Wang et al., 2008). The lithology ischaracterized with conglomerate and coarse sandstones interbedded with medium and fine sandstonesthat normal form graded bedding sequences. The oil-bearing grade is also varying over short interval. In addition to the above, the rock texture differs significantly and can range from massive conglomerates to laminated pebbly sandstones.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">From core observation, the conglomerate is interbedded with sandstone and the oil-bearing grade is varying even in very short interval. From the image texture analysis, it is obvious that the rock is massive and the particle size is varying a lot even within one meter interval. Consequently, the image data and core data indicated the study area is high heterogeneous clastics reservoir (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">From the core observation, 15 different lithology and five oil bearing grades are identified (Figure 5). The lithology is mainly fine grained sandstone in the bottom interval, conglomerate in the middle interval and medium-coarse sandstone in the up interval. The oil bearing gradevaries from oil stains, oil spot to oil immersion accordingly.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">From analysis result of the core data (Figure 6), it clearly showed the good relationship between particle size and oil bearing grade. As the particle size decreasing from medium conglomerate to medium sandstone, the oil bearing grade is increasing. And as the particle size decreasing from fine sandstone to shaly siltstone, the oil bearing grade is also decreasing. Pebbly medium sand and medium sand dominate the highest oil bearing grade.</p><div id="link-7">

A resistivity image spectrum iscalculated circumferentially aroundthe wellbore over a short interval and the sorting index is calculated from the percentile resistivity distributionof the image histogram (Figure 7). The sorting index which may have a relationship with grainsize, rock texture or facies type. It must be verified and validated with core data if to be taken as grain/pore size indicator.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">For this well, the sorting index statistics result shows the sorting index decreases from median conglomerate to medium sand stone, and begins to increase from fine sandstone. For the medium sandstone, the sorting index is the smallest and the oil bearing grade is the highest. As the particle size increasing from medium sandstone to medium conglomerate, the sorting index is increasing and the oil bearing grade is decreasing. As the particle size decreasing from medium sandstone to siltstone, the sorting index is increasing and the oil bearing grade is decreasing. So the sorting index has very close relationship with the particle size and oil bearing grade (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-9">
