McGuire et al (2016) presented that ethane is an excellent injectant for gas injection EOR. Additionally, both rich gases and volatile oils in unconventional reservoirs are promising candidates for ethene injection EOR. Their conclusions were based on both simulation data and three field examples. For the Lawrence Field in the Illinois Basin, the simulation results indicated that the ethane water-alternating-gas (WAG) recovered 48.2% of original oil in place (OOIP),which is 11.8% higher than water flooding, 9.8% higher than CO2 WAG, and 12% higher than methane WAG. According to their research, the difference between CO2 and ethane used for gas injection EOR is summarized and compared in Table 2.</p><p><b>Table 2</b> Comparison between CO<sub>2</sub> and ethane for gas injection EOR</p><p>Table 2 Comparison between CO<sub>2</sub> and ethane for gas injection EOR</p><table id="102118190226MS-Tbl_SPi-2" frame="hsides">
