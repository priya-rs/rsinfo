<p id="Ancr3">The Wattenberg Field is located in the northeast of Denver Colorado, which is presented by the red polygon in Figure 1. It has multiple pay zones, as listed by the stratigraphic column on the right. Starting from 1970, the completion in the Cretaceous J Sandsone made Wattenberg Field discovered. Since early 1980s, Niobrara B Chalk, Niobrara C Chalk, and the underlying Codell Sandstone have been the three targeting zones. Because of low permeability and porosity, they were regarded as unconventional, which requires horizontal drilling with multistage fracture stimulation (Sonnenberg 2015).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">To realize it, an additional 33 billion tonnes of CO2 is required, while only 6%, which is 2 billion tonnes, can be supplied by natual accumulations. One option to get more CO2 is by using carbon capture from coal plants, but the actual costs are appoximately as twice expensive as initially estimated, which limits CO2 supply. That is to say, CO2 supply is far away from enough. Figure 2 (Hill et al 2013) also indicates that the available CO2 sources are much less than the CO2 that is required for EOR projects.</p><div id="link-2">

There are eleven horizontal wells in this study area. These wells were named based on the completion order and the placement of their trajectories. The wells that have an “N” in their names indicate they were located in Niobrara formation.

The green solid curve represents simulated oil production; blue dots were the previously imported actual oil production dataset when the model was created. After the blue dots were overlapped with the green curve, the model ran for another one and half years to predict future production. More real production data were displayed by the gray dots, which matches the green simulation curve. Similar with Well 6N, the simulated oil rate of the other ten wells was also well matched with the real production. This verifies the simulation model.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">Two types of gas huff-n-puff cycles were investigated, as displayed in Figure 7. In Scenario 1,each cycle has a total period of one year: gas is injected into Well 6N for three months, then Well 6N is shut in and soaking for three months. Finally, it is put back into production for six months. In Scenario 2, each huff-n-puff cycle spans two years. A period of six months, six months and twelve months is used for injection, soak and production, respectively. The blue curve in Figure 7 represents Scenario 2, which results in higher oil production. The reason is that longer injection time makes reservoir pressure to increase more and adds more energy into the reservoir, which pushes more oil to be produced.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">Figure 9 compares the oil rate of Well 5C in the above two scenarios, which were about whether 6N was re-openned for production or not. For the two scenarios, each injection cycle covers two years. There were three cycles in each scenario. The gray curve represents the scenario when 6N is injected for six months, soaked for six months, and produced for twelve months; the blue curve displays the scenario that 6N is injected for six months and shut in for the following eighteen months. It is obvious that the blue curve shows higher production than the gray curve, which demonstates the previous hypothesis that there is no need to re-open the injector Well 6N.</p><div id="link-9">

However, for Scenario 2 and 3, though the injected gas contains different ethane composition, 50% and 70%, respectively, the resulted oil production rate curves overlap. Considering ethane can be sold, it is better to inject less ethane and thus Scenario 2 was selected.
