<p id="Ancr2">In 2012, 4 oil producer wells and 1 water injector well were drilled as part of field infill drilling campaign. Currently, nine (9) oil producer wells are producing with four (4) active water injectors (Figure 1). First oil was in 1995 with a peak production at 9000 bopd in 1997. As of 2016, this reservoir is producing at around 3000 bopd with 40% average water cut (Figure 2). Since 2015, it is in the progress of data gathering and well diagnostic for both oil producer and water injector wells especially on the production and injection distribution through production logging for better reservoir understanding.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Well #3 was drilled and completed in April 2012 as a single string oil producer, open hole completion equipped with swell packers and SSDs for each separated Sand A and Sand B, stand alone sand screens, 3-1/2″ upper completion tubing and 2-7/8″ lower completion tubing (Figure 4). Maximum deviation is 42 degrees at 775 mMDTHF. Sand C was not completed at this well during the infill drilling due to water-bearing (low resistivity); suggesting that Sand C at this reservoir is almost flooded compared to A and B. The team believes this is due to much better sand quality at C which results higher productivity index, and also better sweep efficiency at this reservoir from the injectors compared to sand A and B. Consequently, the estimated current water oil contact (COWC) is now interpolated to be 7 meter shallower than the initial OWC. Since completed, the well was producing commingle (A and B) at around 140 bopd only with watercut range of 80-90% (Figure 3) despite evident good sand quality (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">On the other hand, Well #7, also an infill well completed in 2012 with commingling production from sand A, B, and C through long string. The well completed as dual oil producer, equipped with stand alone sand screens, multiple swell packers and SSDs for each separated Sand A, Sand B and Sand C. Production was promising in the beginning with instantaneous rate of close to 1000 bopd. However watercut is seen to increase from 20-90% in 2 years and oil production dropped to 80 bopd (Figure 5). This is unusual compared to nearby wells which have watercut in the range of 20-60% although it’s been producing for more than 10 years.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The well was shut in for more than 24 hours prior to logging. There were two anomalies seen during Shut-in temperature log in the zone interest (Figure 7 – red curve). The first zone from 1503.5m to 1565.5m showed cooling and heating anomalies due to insignificant down crossflow behind the casing. The second zone (1576.8m – 1598.44m) is characterized by a subvertical temperature gradient due to upward crossflow between Sand B and Sand A through the tubing.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">As a result of this run, water source was confirmed to have come from the bottom-most completion, suggesting leak of double valve float shoe installed. An immediate action taken by setting a mechanical plug at the XN-Nipple to prevent water inflow to the tubing. Figure 9 below shows the improvement of production after the water shut-off job. Production increased from 100 to 1000 bopd and watercut dramatically dropped from 80% to as low as 2%.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Based on initial understanding of flooded Sand C and success effort of Well #3, the suspected source of water at Well #7; which is Sand C was then closed via sliding sleeve door (SSD). Results again was a surprise as the oil rate increased from 90 to 2000 bopd. Watercut dropped to as low as 2%. Figure 10 below represents the results for Well #7.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr12">Moving forward, our next effort is optimizing the water injectors to ensure the increase in production does not affect our Reservoir Management Plan (RMP) guideline so that maximized reserves are recovered. Production logging tool (PLT) was run at Well #14 to verify distribution of injected water to of each Sands A, B, and C. Investigation was performed at both shut-in and flowing condition, as well as before and after Sand C was closed to stop unnecessary water injection to Sand C (Figure 11).</p><div id="link-11">
