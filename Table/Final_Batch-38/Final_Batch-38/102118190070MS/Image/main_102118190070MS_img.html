<p id="Ancr1">The same geomechanical technology, validated across many shale basins, is used in this study. Faults interpreted from the seismically derived coherency were used as input in the geomechanical tool using the Material Point Method (MPM) to computationally solve the full continuum mechanics equations (Aimene and Ouenes, 2015). To better represent the role of the natural fractures on the local disturbance of the regional stress, the coherency map is used to create an Equivalent Fracture Model (EFM) in (Fig. 1A) which is used as input in the geomechanical simulation tool. The resulting localized differential stress is shown in (Fig. 1B) where asymmetry is present in many zones.</p><div id="102118190070MS-Img_SPi-1">

<p id="Ancr5">A log of differential stress (Fig. 5A) is extracted along the wellbore from the differential stress map shown in Fig. 1B. The differential stress log is normalized and its distribution along the wellbore is examined. The principle for an engineered completion is to adapt the stage length to the subsurface conditions to treat similar rock throughout a stage, to increase cluster performance. Most companies are currently using the brittleness of the rock along the wellbore to adjust the stage length. Unfortunately, brittleness is often conflated with fracability, and while the brittleness measured at the wellbore plays a major role in the frac initiation, it is the differential stress at the wellbore and beyond that will control the propagation of the hydraulic fracture and its interaction with natural fractures.</p><div id="link-5">
