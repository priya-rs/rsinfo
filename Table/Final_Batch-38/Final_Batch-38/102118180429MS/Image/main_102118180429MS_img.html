<p id="Ancr9">Violating the constant productivity index assumption of the model makes it underperform. In the case of tight reservoirs, applying the CM can be particularly challenging because wells may be stimulated (e.g., fracturing, acid wash/squeezing) frequently, which changes their productivity index. Thus, choosing a time interval (time window), t0 &lt; t &lt; tmax, to perform connectivity analysis without violating this core assumption becomes tricky (Fig. 1) for large areas containing many wells</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">Performing an IWC evaluation over a window area (Figure 2) where there is a flux imbalance however raises a problem, because the CMP is based on material balance. Hence, when the total rate of injectors is significantly different from the total rate of producers, we should add a term to the model to account for the imbalance.</p><div id="link-2">
