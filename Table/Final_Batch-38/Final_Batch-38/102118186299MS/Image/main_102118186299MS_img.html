<p id="Ancr1">Handil field, discovered in 1974, is an oil and gas field located in internal axis of modern Mahakam Delta in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. The field comprises over 550 hydrocarbon accumulations from depth ~ 200mSS to 3300mSS in structurally stacked and compartmentalized fluvio-deltaic sands. Handil reservoirs were divided into several zones, Shallow (very shallow, shallow &amp; upper), Main, Lower, and Deep zone. Shallow zone to Main zone are known as “Oil Pool”, while the bottom of Main zone down to Deep zone are known as “Gas Pool” (Fig.1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Shallow reservoirs are supported by strong aquifer; hence pressure data is not reliable to assist in defining the compartmentalization in the same reservoir segment. Dynamic synthesis was then performed on 36 reservoir layers based on priority list to evaluate and capture such heterogeneity. Figure 2 illustrates iteration process between static and dynamic synthesis. The objectives of the dynamic synthesis are:</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The geomodel update was built with more robust input data (i.e. initial &amp; actual contact, dynamic region) and methodology in order to better capture the reservoir heterogeneity and better understand the uncertainty (Fig.3). The model has delivered re-estimation of initial oil in place, actual oil in place and sweet spot map that became the basis of locating potential future Shallow Zone wells. The objectives and workflow of interest are:</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The example of this workflow can be seen in Figure 4, reservoir 10-3S3 initially had flat OWC but after production for several years it’s confirmed we have dynamic heterogeneity due to production well distribution and static heterogeneity related to facies and sand distribution. This heterogeneity depicted in the 2D net sand map and the 3D model.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The ultimate drainage area of existing production wells was then introduced to the net actual pay map to estimate the future contact movement. It was calculated based on estimated ultimate reserves (EUR) of each production wells in reservoir level and structurally limited by the top perforation. Decline curve analysis (Fig.5) was used to calculate the 1EUR.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Blind test for the sweetspot result was performed on 2016 wells to check the accuracy of the netpay prediction from the geomodel. From this blind test, it can be concluded that the shallow geomodel gives quite good net pay prediction despite its tendency to be slightly pessimistic. The main uncertainties are the fluid status which affected by production and sand occurrence in some reservoirs. Summary of blind test result can be seen in the Figure 7.</p><div id="link-7">

This value will limit the number of wells that penetrating each reservoir compartment. Monte Carlo technique was used to define the maximum wells for each reservoir compartment. Main parameters that used in the calculation are future ROIP and future well reserves. Figure 8 illustrates the workflow to calculate the maximum wells for each compartment.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">Figure 9 shows example of future well or perforation reserves calculation methodology. Blind test was performed in 8 reservoir segment to check the validity of the reserves calculation methodology. Main uncertainties in this methodology are the production allocation and the estimated ultimate reserves. Blind test was performed on 2012 – 2014 wells, which have less uncertainty in production allocation since we have representative PLT data and the production decline trend already obvious. Based on the blind test result (Fig.10), post drilling reserves estimation is in good agreement with the actual reserves realization, total difference ~6%.</p><div id="link-9">
