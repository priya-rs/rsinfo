<p id="Ancr4">The project involves tying up multiple reservoirs together and separating out the reservoir fluids in the surface network – including the handling and separation of sour gas (the asset has a high H2S content in reservoir fluids). The separated acid and sour gases will be compressed at a high pressure and re-injected into the various reservoirs to create miscibility in the oil thereby increasing its mobility, and to prevent the rapid decline in reservoir pressures. The approximate location of the development in Oman is shown in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 4 shows the P-T phase diagram for all the fluids – the 9 reservoir fluids, and the integrated fluid blend used in the surface network. The phase diagram for the integrated fluid is for representation purposes only and is constructed assuming equal volume fractions of all the 9 reservoir fluids. In reality, this will dynamically change during the course of the simulation and field operation changes.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr12">In this project, although the work is still underway, many of the challenges faced by typical IPSM challenges were handled efficiently using the new approach. Multiple users and disciplines were able to collaborate using a single tool and share data seamlessly with each other. The fluid continuity was maintained and the reservoir and production systems were truly coupled together to reduce the errors in such system models. Figure 9 shows a schematic detailing the various aspects of this approach (Pathak et. al., 2016).</p><div id="link-9">
