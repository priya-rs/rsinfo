<p id="Ancr1">As the fracturing fluid propagates through the tensile deformation of the rock and meets the natural fracture, the natural fracture properties and pressure in the induced fracture determine either of the three outcomes: the hydraulic fracture may propagate through the natural fracture, the hydraulic fracture may be arrested by the natural fracture, or the hydraulic fracture may intersect and propagate in the natural fracture and subsequently cross it (Fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Recently, Cohen et al. (2017) presented a theoretical approach to account for vertical heterogeneity in the natural fracture network (Fig. 2) as they modified the fracture model to honor the crossing criteria developed by Gu and Weng (2010), but over different vertical layers as per the DFN variability, hence, the multilayer DFN (MDFN). However, there has been no application presented in the literature to evaluate the use of an MDFN coupled to a complex fracture model in predicting the fracture geometry in shale reservoirs. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to provide supplemental evidence and a workflow for applying the MDFN approach wherever applicable for improving the predictability of well completions and their production performance.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The horizontal well studied by Ajisafe et al. (2016) and here in this paper was drilled to target the Avalon shale in the Delaware basin with 11 fracturing stages completed with the plug-and-perforation technique. The DFN model shows variation in all three dimensions around the wellbore. Therefore, the hydraulic fracture geometry expected in the wellbore had bearing on the density of natural fractures and their distribution. This was also indicated by the microseismic data collected during the stimulation because they show variance along the wellbore (Fig. 3) as well as vertically (Fig. 4). When the DFN is plotted as a cross-section along the wellbore, the vertical variation is evident, and therefore the well completion and performance modeling approach warrants a greater focus on DFN variability in the vertical dimension, and it is as important as the horizontal variability.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The DFN model is then discretized into various elements represented across the layers in Avalon shale. This allows creating a subdivision of the 3D DFN model as per the layers defined in the geocellular model (Fig. 5). The MDFN created in this study is different from that presented by Ajisafe et al. (2016) where they had considered a SDFN. The SDFN in that study was created by a slice of the 3D-DFN close to the wellbore. These natural fractures captured in the SDFN may have the first impact on creating the complexity because of the fact that the fracturing fluid will propagate laterally as it comes out of the perforation clusters.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">The hydraulic fracturing treatment pressure response on the surface may not be very different between the two approaches. The fracture treatment pressure history was plotted together for both the scenarios, and it was found that the stimulation pressure history for both the cases were very similar. The surface areas created by the two fracture simulation cases have only a minor difference at the end; the case with the MDFN adds just over 18% higher surface area due to added complexity with more natural fracture interaction (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">There is some minor variability between the two cases, as seen in Fig. 8. However, when the propped fraction of the hydraulic fractures is computed, we observe that the model predicts greater propped surface area with the SDFN than with the MDFN approach (Fig. 9) due to the fact that the proppant transport is compromised at an increased complexity. Therefore, the proppants stay closer to the wellbore, and the surface area created by the hydraulic fracture across various layers as they propagate and make complexity may show greater unpropped fractions.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">The maximum surface pressures for the two approaches of modeling show a similar pressure trend. Fig. 10 shows the maximum surface pressure modeled by the two approaches. Therefore, execution data from the field may not be enough to determine if the fractures are creating additional complexity in the vertical direction due to interaction with natural fractures or whether the fracture is only creating complexity in the horizontal plane of propagation. Advanced modeling as proposed in this study can only predict the response and hydraulic fracture complexity with varying DFN vertically.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr30">Fracture modeling has advanced from the early concepts of no natural fracture impact on hydraulic fracture geometry to the newer complex fracture models with transport of fluids and proppants (Fig. 30). The MDFN approach honors the heterogeneous natural fracture system and provides a better representation of the subsurface interaction of induced hydraulic fractures and hence, better well performance. However, the model still assumes that the natural fractures are vertical in the individual sublayers of the reservoirs.</p><div id="link-30">
