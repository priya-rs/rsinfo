<p id="Ancr3">In solubilisation efficiency tests, the surfactant solution and crude oil were shaken together at room temperature in special laboratory equipment (Fig. 1). After a certain rest time, and following separation of the phases the volumes of the formed phases were measured. After 24 hours storage at reservoir temperature, the volumes of phases were repeatedly determined. The amounts of aqueous phase, emulsion and oil are determined like comparing to the total liquid volume. The solubilisation efficiency could be analyzed concerning the different effect of the surfactant mixture on the type of emulsions usually formed in the natural reservoir by the native phases.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Usually, actual interfacial tension between efficient surfactant mixtures and oil was around 10-2 mN/m as it is shown with green line in Fig. 2. Thus, the characteristic IFT is 3,500 times lower than the original IFT between the brine and oil phases, viz. that value is quite comparable with data published in literature. That minimum value of IFT was obtained at 0.5 g/l surfactant concentration whereas the maximum IFT lowering value was often measured at 0.1 g/l.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">A positive, structure-strengthening effect could be observed not only in polymer solutions, but in surfactant/polymer solutions also. The presence of polymer plays a predominant effect of internal structure of systems and therefore, the viscoelastic character of displacing fluid may have beneficial effect on displacement efficiency too. The thermal stability of the selected surfactant/polymer solutions could also be checked by measuring the change of viscosity of solution in time. Probably some segments of polymer chains may degrade at high temperature resulting in decreased viscosity. Surprisingly, in contrast to this fundamental prediction, the fact is that the viscosity of tested surfactant/polymer solution significantly increased as shown in Fig. 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The flow and displacement tests were carried out at constant injection rate, which corresponded to 20-60 cm/day linear front rate in the cores. This flow rate is modelling the flow of fluids moving from injection wells towards production wells in the reservoir. The effluent samples were collected in volume of 10-50 cm3 depending on the length of the cores. The oil content was determined in each sample breaking the emulsions if they existed. Special mathematical procedure was used to calculate the total incremental oil volume and the recovery efficiency during the core-flooding test. The results of a typical core-flooding test are shown in Fig. 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">The well was first tested with KCl injection as a pre-treatment to control clay swelling near the bore zone to improve the injectivity of the former production well. Then it was shut in until the injection of surfactant/polymer solution. The injection started with 100 m3/d water injection and then the chemical solution containing 15,000 ppm surfactant and 1,000 ppm polymer was continuously injected into the well from 30th September through 25th October, 2013. In this period 2,000 m3 surfactant/polymer solution with 12-15 mPa s viscosity was injected into the reservoir. In the final stage, the chemical solution was driven deeply into the reservoir injecting additional 100 m3 water. A sophisticated slicing and mixing unit was deployed and used for preparation and injection of surfactant/polymer solution at the well-site (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">The injection lasted almost a month and the operation was precisely monitored by measuring the wellhead pressure, injection rate and viscosity of injected fluids. During the injection period, flow rate was practically stable and wellhead pressure gradually increased as expected indicating a normal trend and good injectivity of the surfactant/polymer solution (Fig. 8).</p><div id="link-8">

Right now, the approved project is already running and the surfactant/polymer solution is being injected by state of the art injection technology (Fig. 9) into two injection wells from April 2016 and as planned, it will end only in 2019 after 45 months injection period.</p><div id="link-9">
