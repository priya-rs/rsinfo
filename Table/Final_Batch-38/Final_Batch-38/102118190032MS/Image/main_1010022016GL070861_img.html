A dome-shaped reservoir with four layers is located within the depth interval of 1.4 km to 1.6 km. The reservoir is confined between overburden and under burden and is intersected by a non-conductive fault dipping 80 degrees to west and striking north-south.

Positive pressure changes, i.e. overpressure, result from injection and negative pressure changes, i.e. pressure depletion, result from production. One important thing to note is that on the footwall side of ProdSimilar, we see larger drop in pressure although the footwall side well is producing at a rate lower than the hanging wall side.

<p id="Ancr13">This causes the top of the reservoir to reach the failure line (Figure 11) and slip in this case. Slip nucleates on the fault at the bottom of the top reservoir layer where the change in effective normal traction is tensile and the change in shear traction is downdip. A downdip change in shear traction is consistent with the production-induced contraction of the reservoir. The slip direction at the nucleation point is downdip. This induces a downdip pull on the fault nodes in the overburden layer immediately above the reservoir.</p><div id="102118190032MS-Img_SPi-11">

<p id="Ancr14">When we observe Figure 12, we notice that the shear traction change should be magnified over time because both sides of the reservoir contracts in Prod and ProdSimilar cases. In the Inj and InjSimilar cases, the footwall side contracts and the hanging wall side expands. However, we see that the shear changes are actually magnified in the producer-injector case instead of the producer-producer case as shown in Figure 8. This can be attributed to the sign convention used in the simulator. The simulator uses the fault normal vector to attribute signs for the shear traction.</p><div id="link-12">
