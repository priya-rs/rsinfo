<p id="Ancr8">Based on log data, true resistivity log (RT) shows variation of resistivity value in South Sumatera Basin (Fig. 6). Fig. 6 identifies two groups of resistivity value in South Sumatera Basin: High Resistivity Pay and Low Resistivity Pay. Based on well test result statistically (Fig. 6), chance of success for LRPZ is lower than High Resistivity Pay Zone (HRPZ) in South Sumatera Basin. True resistivity (RT) comparation between success well test cases and failed well test cases (wet test) indicates that RT can not be used as single data, but it need to be integrated with the other data to determine reservoir pay zone (indicating for flowing hydrocarbon) for well testing interval candidates.</p><div id="link-6">

In this research, shale distribution model was built using the Thomas and Stieber (1975) model presented on Fig. 15A and Fig. 15 B. This approach has come to identify the shale type by using Vcl and PHIE as axes, which then will help to describe what causes the LRP in South Sumatera Basin. Fig. 15A and Fig. 15 B explain that Talang Akar formation in South Sumatera Basin has a dispersed-laminated shale type reservoir dominantly. Fig. 15A and Fig. 15 B show that Talang Akar reservoir interval is mainly composed by Dispersed–Laminated shale. It indicates the causes controlling LRPZ of Talang Akar in South Sumatera Basin is fine grained, or superficial microporosity.</p><div id="link-15">
