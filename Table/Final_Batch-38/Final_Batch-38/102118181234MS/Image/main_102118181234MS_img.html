<p id="Ancr1">Operators are continuously improving their well design, drilling, and stimulation techniques, resulting in considerably higher initial production. According to the February 2016 Drilling Report published by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the initial production rates continues to increase on a year-by-year basis and operators are able to produce more oil during the initial months from new wells. Fig. 1 illustrates the increasing trend of the average daily oil production on a year by year basis.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The shape of the H-Q curve of a centrifugal pump is characteristic of its own stage design and geometry. Fig. 3 shows examples of three different shapes of H-Q curves of 400 Series pumps (4-in OD) for ESP applications. The D3500N pump H-Q curve shows the profile of a continuously decreasing head with increasing flow rate from the zero to the maximum flow rate. Pumps with this shape of H-Q curve (dH/dQ&lt;0) are sometimes referred to as having a stable pump curve.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr8">Several aspects are considered when defining the minimum and maximum limits of the ROR for a pump stage including variability of pump performance and test curves, the net axial thrust, and efficiency. Also, in some cases like the example illustrated in Fig. 8, the lower flow rate limit of the ROR is set based on the shape of the H-Q curve. The example shows the catalog curve for a RC4000 pump stage with its ROR between 3,500 bbl/d and 7000 bbl/d at 60 Hz.</p><div id="link-8">
