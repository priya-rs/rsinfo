<p id="Ancr6">Field production facilities comprise a single unmanned installation (NUI), which is connected by a 13.4-km pipeline to the Markham J6A facilities (Fig. 1). After metering on J6A, the gas is exported to Den Helder in the Netherlands for conditioning and blending. Based on results from the A sand infill well, the operator objective was to assess the potential to drill additional development wells in the A sand reservoir unit, which contains ~50% of the total field gas initially-in-place (GIIP).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">The Westphalian formation consists of fluvio-deltaic sediments that contain active and abandoned distributary channels interbedded with associated overbank and levee deposits. Based on core and production data, the basal A sandstones are generally of poorer quality than the overlying B, C, and D sandstone reservoirs (Fig. 2). However, the undepleted nature of the sandstones makes them an attractive target for (fracture stimulated) infill production wells.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">The completion design (Fig. 3) was for a platform well that could be hydraulically fractured and cleaned up, with the installation of a downhole pressure/temperature gauge (DHPG) to provide accurate data for both the stimulation treatment and long-term reservoir management, as detailed in previous papers (Langford et al. 2014). A tubing hanger was used while fracturing, and the treatment was performedthrough the permanent completion string, which included a subsurface safety valve (SSSV).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The planned strategy was to use a 7-ft perforation length in a 10-ft gun carrier loaded with 4 spf at 0/180° gravity orientated phasing (Fig. 5). The planned charges to be run were a big-shot-based RDX charge, providing a large entrance hole to reduce the risk of premature bridging and screenout at the perforations. These are the same perforation charges run on the two most recent perforated stimulated wells by Centrica at the time; Kew (49/4c-7Y) and Ensign ED (48/14A-7Y) (Langford et al. 2014).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr14">Fractures 3, 4, and 5 were performed using the same procedure as for the diagnostic testing. In all cases, a single dominant fracture was indicated, the 100-mesh slug was omitted on all treatments, and schedules similar to those shown in Table 3 were successfully pumped with concentrations of 4 to 16 lbm/gal (480 to 1920 kg/m3). The proppant plugs for Fractures 3 and 4 were placed in such a way that testing with CT was not required. Fracture 5 ended with a proppant concentration up to 7 lbm/gal (840 kg/m3). As this was the final treatment, a proppant plug was not required. An overview of the treatments is given in Table 4. A total of 1.5 million lbm of proppant was pumped using more than 19,000 bbl of fluid. The well situation after the final treatment and before cleaning out the well is shown in Figs. 9 and 10.</p><div id="link-9">
