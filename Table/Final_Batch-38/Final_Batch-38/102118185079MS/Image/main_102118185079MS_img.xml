<anchoringText id="Ancr6">The fluids distribution in the Eagle Ford shale is exactly the opposite of what occurs in conventional reservoirs (Figure 1), where the fluids distribution is governed by gravity/density segregation. In the Eagle Ford the distribution is “upside-down”. Ramirez and Aguilera (2016) have shown that fluids in shale reservoirs have remained with approximately the same original distribution (i.e. approximately the same dry gas-condensate contact and approximately the same condensate-oil contact) over geologic time.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">The conceptual model used in this study was proposed by Fragoso et al. (2015). This model is holistic and shows how the production of liquids can be increased under favorable conditions with the use of gas injection. The addition of heavier ends to the injection stream increases even more the recovery of liquids. The basic idea is explained with the use of the schematic presented in Figure 2, which includes all the fluids considered in this investigation.</anchoringText>

Upon initiation of gas injection, the oil rate grows gradually until it reaches a maximum of 215 bbl/day. Then it decreases gradually and eventually stabilizes at approximately 70 bbl/day (Figure 11). Gas injection restores the reservoir pressure, which is significantly reduced during primary recovery.

<anchoringText id="Ancr17">Figure 12 presents the results. The higher recoveries are obtained when injection starts at the beginning of production. Thus, the aforementioned rule of thumb for conventional reservoirs does not apply in the case of shales. Maybe the bubble point pressure is too low compared to the initial reservoir pressure, but most likely the rule is not valid in fractured shale reservoirs due to the different mechanisms active when oil is displaced by gas in these types of reservoirs.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr24">Oil recoveries from the oil container can be also increased by means of huff and puff dry gas injection. The results are much better than those obtained by continuous gas injection. Oil recovery after 20 years is 28.9%, which is four times the primary recovery (Figure 19); this is outstanding. The best performance of the huff and puff gas injection can be explained by considering gas flow from the injection to the production wells through natural fractures.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr25">The best performance of the huff and puff gas injection can be explained by considering gas flow from the injection to the production wells through natural fractures. In huff and puff, as injection and production operations are carried out in the same well, gas can penetrate the matrix more efficiently. In the continuous injection, the gas moves through fractures without allowing enough time for soaking and penetrating the matrix. Figure 20 presents oil recoveries vs. pore volumes injected at reservoir conditions. After 15 years of gas injection, one pore volume of gas at reservoir conditions has been injected.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr30">Previously, it has been demonstrated that the mass transfer by molecular diffusion is crucial when continuous gas injection is used to increase liquid recoveries in the oil and condensate containers. Conversely, the performance of a huff and puff injection is barely affected by the absence of molecular diffusion as shown in Figure 25. As only one well is used for injection and production, the gas remains in the reservoir at high pressure during the injection part of the cycle, instead of flowing from one well to another through natural fractures. Therefore, even if there is no molecular diffusion, injected gas is given enough time to penetrate the matrix.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr44">Oil recoveries in the condensate container by continuous gas injection are shown in Figure 39. The situation is similar to that observed in the oil container. Although the incremental oil recovery after 20 years of simulated production is somewhat larger for the GEM model compared to the integrated model, it can be seen from the plots that in the GEM model alone (Figure 14), the curve is concave downwards, while in the integrated model (Figure 39), the curve is almost a straight line. This means that in future years, the recovery increment would be higher in the integrated model. The BHP explanation presented above for the oil container (Figure 38) also applies for BHPs in the condensate container (see Figure 40).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr46">Figure 41 presents oil recoveries from the oil container by huff and puff gas injection. The high BHPs caused by backpressures from the surface facilities affects negatively the gas huff and puff gas injection during the first few years. This is concluded by making a comparison with recoveries from the GEM model (Figure 19). However, the increase in recoveries is more “stable” in the integrated model (recovery increases very slowly in the GEM model after six years of injection), which may deliver better results in the long term.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr47">The facilities back pressures have a strong negative effect on the huff and puff gas injection performance in the condensate container (Figure 42). Previously, a significant improvement in oil recovery was obtained by huff and puff gas injection in the condensate container (Figure 26) using the GEM model, where the BHP declined freely during the puff periods to the minimum value defined as a constraint.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr48">Installation of a compressor close to the wellhead in the condensate container does barely affect oil recoveries from the oil container as shown in Figure 43. This is significant from a practical point of view. On the other hand, Figure 44 shows that the inclusion of a compressor near the well producing from the condensate container helps to increase liquids recoveries by huff and puff gas injection. The BHPs are lower in this case, allowing thus to produce at higher rates during the puff periods.</anchoringText>

In this case, the subsurface pump helps to increase the recoveries obtained during the first years of the project, which in practice is desirable. Results are presented in Figure 45.</anchoringText>
