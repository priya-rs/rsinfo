<p id="Ancr6">The fluids distribution in the Eagle Ford shale is exactly the opposite of what occurs in conventional reservoirs (Figure 1), where the fluids distribution is governed by gravity/density segregation. In the Eagle Ford the distribution is “upside-down”. Ramirez and Aguilera (2016) have shown that fluids in shale reservoirs have remained with approximately the same original distribution (i.e. approximately the same dry gas-condensate contact and approximately the same condensate-oil contact) over geologic time.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">The conceptual model used in this study was proposed by Fragoso et al. (2015). This model is holistic and shows how the production of liquids can be increased under favorable conditions with the use of gas injection. The addition of heavier ends to the injection stream increases even more the recovery of liquids. The basic idea is explained with the use of the schematic presented in Figure 2, which includes all the fluids considered in this investigation.</p><div id="102118185079MS-Img_SPi-2">

Thus, the aforementioned rule of thumb for conventional reservoirs does not apply in the case of shales. Maybe the bubble point pressure is too low compared to the initial reservoir pressure, but most likely the rule is not valid in fractured shale reservoirs due to the different mechanisms active when oil is displaced by gas in these types of reservoirs.</p><div id="link-12">

In huff and puff, as injection and production operations are carried out in the same well, gas can penetrate the matrix more efficiently. In the continuous injection, the gas moves through fractures without allowing enough time for soaking and penetrating the matrix.

After 15 years of gas injection, one pore volume of gas at reservoir conditions has been injected.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr27">This may be improved by using longer huff periods over time once the huff and puff effectiveness starts to decrease. This is demonstrated in Figure 22 where after 9.4 years of production (4.4 years huff and puff injection, or 8 cycles of 100-day injection and 100-day production), the cycles are modified to 200 days of injection and 100 days of production. By implementing this modification, the injected gas can travel further into the reservoir, thus contacting new oil during the late life of the process and improving recoveries significantly.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr30">Previously, it has been demonstrated that the mass transfer by molecular diffusion is crucial when continuous gas injection is used to increase liquid recoveries in the oil and condensate containers. Conversely, the performance of a huff and puff injection is barely affected by the absence of molecular diffusion as shown in Figure 25. As only one well is used for injection and production, the gas remains in the reservoir at high pressure during the injection part of the cycle, instead of flowing from one well to another through natural fractures. Therefore, even if there is no molecular diffusion, injected gas is given enough time to penetrate the matrix.</p><div id="link-25">

In the first stage, the CO2 is removed from the gas stream.

<p id="Ancr49">Installation of a compressor close to the wellhead in the condensate container does barely affect oil recoveries from the oil container as shown in Figure 43. This is significant from a practical point of view. On the other hand, Figure 44 shows that the inclusion of a compressor near the well producing from the condensate container helps to increase liquids recoveries by huff and puff gas injection. The BHPs are lower in this case, allowing thus to produce at higher rates during the puff periods.</p><div id="link-44">

<p id="Ancr50">Another situation of practical importance is the case where a subsurface pump generates low BHPs in the producing well of the oil container. In this case, the subsurface pump helps to increase the recoveries obtained during the first years of the project, which in practice is desirable. Results are presented in Figure 45.</p><div id="link-45">

<p id="Ancr51">A pump that generates low BHPs may also be used to solve the problem originated by backpressures in the condensate container (in a real case, this pump must have the capacity to handle high GORs). Results are similar to those obtained by installing a compressor close to the wellhead, as shown in Figure 46.</p><div id="link-46">
