<anchoringText id="Ancr2">The Biafra Member (Figure-2) which includes all reservoirs from P-4 to I-4 is a deltaic sequence made-up of numerous stacked, upward-coarsening units, with prodelta shales and silts near the base, grading upwards into medium- to coarse-grained upper-delta and shallow-marine sandstones at the top. The reservoir sandstones of the Biafra Member were deposited in a high-energy, wave-dominated deltaic environment, prograding over the thick prodelta shales of the Akata Formation. The Akata Formation is the main hydrocarbon source rock for the overlying Biafra reservoir sands.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr3">The interpre-tation of the petrophysical logs is refined by integration of rock physics knowledge to define the impact of clays distribution contributing to the low resistivity effect with confirmation of dispersed clay content. Rock typing and structure characterization is improved by the detailed investigation of NMR signal distribution compared to features revealed by borehole images data at highest resolution. Finally, the results of extensive core data analysis is made available and added to the evaluation workflow (Figure-3) to validate the parameters and verify the rock properties at different scale.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">Several intervals prone to develop into LRLC sand reservoirs have also been identified during drilling; however routine logs data acquisition is basic and insufficient to delineate and quantify to any extent this LRLC sand. To confirm the existence of a reservoir system and producible hydrocarbon, a recent well was designed to target the evaluation of the potential LRLC layers.

<caption>Core data integrated to petrophysical logs results. Spectral analysis of Thorium, Uranium, and Potassium from cores (Track 1) is added to the petrophysical evaluation for complete clays analysis; there is a good agreement between the total porosity from cores and the NMR fluid corrected porosity as well as porosity from matrix corrected neutron-density logs (Track 4). The fluids saturation from logs is also validated by core data analysis (Track 7) as well as the fluid ability to move depicted by advanced NMR study with refined cutoffs (Track 8). Core pictures: fine sandy heterolith with mud/organic (a), fine grained, silty sandstone (b), massive well sorted fine grained sandstone with better porosity (c), very fine silty sandstone mixed with muddy heterolith predominant at the base (d)</caption>
