<p id="Ancr2">The Biafra Member (Figure-2) which includes all reservoirs from P-4 to I-4 is a deltaic sequence made-up of numerous stacked, upward-coarsening units, with prodelta shales and silts near the base, grading upwards into medium- to coarse-grained upper-delta and shallow-marine sandstones at the top. The reservoir sandstones of the Biafra Member were deposited in a high-energy, wave-dominated deltaic environment, prograding over the thick prodelta shales of the Akata Formation. The Akata Formation is the main hydrocarbon source rock for the overlying Biafra reservoir sands.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The interpre-tation of the petrophysical logs is refined by integration of rock physics knowledge to define the impact of clays distribution contributing to the low resistivity effect with confirmation of dispersed clay content. Rock typing and structure characterization is improved by the detailed investigation of NMR signal distribution compared to features revealed by borehole images data at highest resolution. Finally, the results of extensive core data analysis is made available and added to the evaluation workflow (Figure-3) to validate the parameters and verify the rock properties at different scale.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Several intervals prone to develop into LRLC sand reservoirs have also been identified during drilling; however routine logs data acquisition is basic and insufficient to delineate and quantify to any extent this LRLC sand. To confirm the existence of a reservoir system and producible hydrocarbon, a recent well was designed to target the evaluation of the potential LRLC layers. Detailed interpretation of borehole image logs with dips and texture with core snaps (Figure-4) suggested the reservoir interval to have been deposited around the pro-delta (Figure-5) in a shallow marine environment with low energy of deposition.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">Remapping these intervals using modern petrophysical techniques linked to geology from images and cores have significant production and reserve implications as pictured in the study. Log responses are studied on high level of detail to derive rock quality, fluids content, and their ability to move. The main petrophysical outputs over the zone of interested are summarized in the Figure-6 (image compressed at 1:100).</p><div id="link-6">
