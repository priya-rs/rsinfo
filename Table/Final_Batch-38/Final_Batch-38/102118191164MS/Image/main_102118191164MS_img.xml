<anchoringText id="Ancr2">A field offshore Southwest Trinidad contains prolific shaly sand reservoirs belonging to the Manzanilla Formation (Fig. 1). The field is part of the northern flank of the Central Range of Trinidad and the reservoirs in the field are part of a syncline trending E-W with dips of 45 degrees on the flanks. The flanks are affected by strike slip and reverse faults. Some of these faults have been reactivated by normal faults. As such, reservoirs are highly compartmentalized and oil gravities and viscosities vary across the field (from 15-40 API).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr3">This section converted Windows sums into T2 distributions based on cutoffs, computed uncertainties for porosity and the T2log mean and computed a bad hole flag based on T2 signal. The bin porosity cutoffs were used as default, since there was no NMR data run in core to calibrate the T2 cutoff. In particular, the T2 cutoff separating free and bound fluids were left at 33ms as recommended by Coates, Xiao, and Prammer (1999) in the absence of core data and the lack of paramagnetic minerals. The default permeability exponents for the SDR and Timur-Coates equation was also subsequently left as default. An example of the processing output in wells AD2 and AD3 in Figure 2.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr7">The range of variation in outputs ranged from 5% in some cleaner intervals to 40% in shalier ones. A distribution of the VSH outputs in one such interval is shown in figure 6. VSH_CMR was computed only as a comparison since it was not needed as an input in analytical techniques using CMR data but was found to vary closely with VSN_ND. After looking at all of the volumes of shale, a minimum merged method was applied to derive the final volumes of shale. It was decided use both this merged minimum volume of shale and the VSH_GR_Linear volumes (maximum) to evaluate the impact from both methods on porosities and saturations.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">Overall, the volumes of clay derived from Gamma Ray trended similarly to VSH since they were related by a derived clay / silt ratio of 55:45. The variation of clay volumes (as can be seen in figure 7) was found to be narrower than those for the Volumes of Shale. VCL_CMR related very well with the VCL_ND in good hole conditions. Considering that the VCL_ND was derived using external mineralogical data, this finding suggests that the VCL_CMR can be potentially used to inform VCL outputs from using conventional data. The VCL_Steiber related closely to VCL_ND and was used as the Vclay input in the bad hole sections.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">In these shalier zones, the TCMR lies between Neutron Density average and the Density porosity. For example, the shaly sand interval at top of the zone 2784’ -2850'in well AD1 shows Neutron porosity average is around 42% whereas the density porosity reads around 30-34% (Figure 8). The Neutron density average is 38-40%. The CMR total porosity is around 30-33% and is generally around the density porosity. In another shaly interval, 4066’ – 4092’ in AD3, this oil bearing sand has a total porosity of around 33% according to the Total CMR porosity matches the density porosity and Neutron Density porosity average.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr10">When comparing to core data (as can be seen in figure 9), the total core porosities matched Dual Water total porosities derived from Density porosity and VCL_ND porosities in slightly shaly zones and Density porosity in clean zones. The total CMR porosity correlated well with these Dual Water total porosities porosities regardless of shale content in good hole sections and so would have had a good match with core data. Since there were no centrifuge core porosities, comparison against external data was not possible for the effective porosities.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">When looking at the core data, the core water saturations were also slightly higher than the Swt using Density porosity and VCL_ND volumes as can be seen in figure 10. This suggests using Swt Dual CMR would have had a better match to core data. It should be noted that even though core water saturations are the baseline for comparison, there are still uncertainties in actual water and oil volumes recovered due to the core collection and cleaning process.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr12">Irreducible water saturation (Swirr) was calculated using Capillary Bound Fluid Volume from NMR data. The resulting irreducible water saturations from CMR ranged from 25% to 50% in some intervals in wells AD1and AD3 as seen in Table 1 above. In well AD8, irreducible water saturations ranged from 30% to 50%(as seen in figure 11). When comparing NMR derived water saturations with critical water saturations from core analysis in well AD18, it was observed that in zone 4b, sw_core was 40-50% whereas Sw_CMR ranged 30-45%. Similar correlations were noted in Zones 3a and 3b. It is possible that the critical water saturation from core data could also be affected the collection mechanisms and cleaning and measuring processes.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr13">Permeabilities were derived from NMR data using default exponents and so interpretation of the NMR derived permeabilities were only handled qualitatively and compared on a trend basis. It was observed that when comparing well AD1 and AD7 zone 1 (figure 12), the NMR derived permeabilities followed the same trend as the core derived permeabilities, in the top part of the section but numerically around the same 1000mD order in the bottom part of the section. In well AD8 for example, the Timur Coates (KTIM) permeabilities follow the same trend as the sidewall core permeabilities but are an order lower in absolute values (as seen in figure 11).</anchoringText>

According to the evaluation done the sands in wells AD1 and AD3, sands are at irreducible condition and should produce hydrocarbon relatively water free (as shown in figure 13). In well AD2, however, out of the 7 hydrocarbon bearing intervals the reservoirs appear to have very little moveable water (5-7%) with slightly more in the bottom two sands.</anchoringText>
