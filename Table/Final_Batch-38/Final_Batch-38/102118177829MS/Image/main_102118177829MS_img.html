<p id="Ancr1">An example that has been documented to demonstrate this point refers to the rate of divorce in the state of Maine (in the United States of America) between the years 2000 and 2009 that demonstrate almost a perfect correlation with per capita consumption of margarine in the United States. Although there is a perfect correlation between the two (Figure 1 shows a correlation of 0.993), it is highly doubtful that one has caused the other.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">As shown in Figure 2 every grid block from every run of the numerical reservoir simulation model generates a record that is used to train the SRM. In this figure the grid block shown in pink (and marked as Tier 0) is the target grid block. In every run, eventually every grid block in the numerical model becomes the target grid block. For example given the fact that six simulation runs were used to develop the SRM for this project, and that the model includes 2.5 million grid blocks, every single neural network is trained using a database that included 6 × 2.5 = 15 million records at every time step.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The geologic model developed using a commercial software application included more than 21 million grid blocks. The geologic model was up-scaled to almost 2.5 million grid blocks to be used in the flow model. The model included two different PVT regions and 8 different rock types, 12 regions for the fluidin-place, multiple high permeability streaks, with the typical inter-well spacing of about 1 kilometer. Relative location of more than 500 wells that were modeled in this project are shown in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Upon completion of the SRM we needed to check its accuracy. First we compared the results from the SRM with one of the runs that was used in the training. The comparison was made on a well by well basis and also when all the results from all the wells were summed to represent the production from the entire field. Figure 5 shows the results of this test for the entire field. This figure includes three graphs. The graph on the top shows the results of the oil production for the entire field. In this graph the annual oil production rate results generated by the SRM are shown by solid line while similar results from the numerical simulation model are shown using green circles.</p><div id="link-5">
