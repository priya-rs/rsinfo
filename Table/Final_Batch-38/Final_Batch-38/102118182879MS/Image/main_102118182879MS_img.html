<p id="Ancr2">This paper presents the result of three years of analysis and field testing between the service company and operator. The goal of this project was to address the main issue in southwest Oman, in one of the main clusters, which consists of nine reservoirs in two formations, in seven different fields. Those fields were developed between 1997 and 2002. The drilling process was delayed most of the time because of the technological limitations and high risks presented in the 12 1/4-in. section. Fig. 1 illustrates the catalog of Oman lithostigraphy.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The objective in this area is drilling oil wells in an efficient manner while developing an understanding of how to drill in the Amin formation using the best drilling practices. The Amin formation has wide thickness and is composed of three different layers formed by the Amin Upper, Intra Amin, and Amin Lower, with varying lithology that generally consists of sandstone, conglomerate, shale, and limestone. The 12 1/4-in. section begins at approximately 500 to 600 m and extends to approximately 3800 to 4250 m. Additionally, the compressive rock strength values vary based on depth and thickness. Fig. 2 presents Amin Formation thickness from north to south.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">One of the main sources affecting the bit performance is the drive system and BHA design. The most efficient way to drill a hard conglomerate is to use a high torque and low speed motor. A 9 5/8-in. motor with 6:7 Lobe–3.5 stage was recommended to use to drill the section, delivering a high torque over 10,000 ft-lb. Fig. 7 (SperryDrill 2009) shows a graph with the operating parameters across the motor.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The success of BHA designs deepens on the ability to model it under real conditions to minimize torque, drag, and bending stress, and predicts critical speeds to reduce harmful drilling vibrations. A force analysis of the BHA was calculated to determinate the forces acting on the bit and the stabilizers using the specific well conditions, weight on bit (WOB), inclination, DLS, formation index, and mud weight.Fig. 8 illustrates the optimized BHA design simulation reducing the bending forces.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">Whirl sensitivity analysis was particularly studied to determine the lateral natural frequencies (critical rotary speeds) and mode shapes of the BHA at different values of specific drilling parameters including hole size, WOB, hole inclination, dogleg severity (DLS), formation index, and mud weight. The BHA vibration analysis gave the optimum range of WOB and RPMs to minimize vibration to ensure that adequate energy is transferred to the bit for an optimum bit depth of cut and stability. Fig. 9 illustrates the BHA whirl sensitivity analysis simulation, highlighting in green the optimum run WOB and RPM avoiding critical BHA speeds in blue.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">Historically, PDC cutters are laid out on the bit face starting from the bit center following a spiral direction toward the bit gage. Fig. 10 (Chen et al. 2010) depicts an example of a traditional cutting structure layout on bit face and profile for a six-bladed bit Fig. 11 (Chen et al. 2010). At the start of drilling, there can be only one cutter near the nose point engaging with the formation and an initial imbalance force is usually huge (refer to Point A). As the drilling depth increases, peaks of imbalance force occur because only some of the cutters are engaged with the formation.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">Multilevel force balance arranges the cutter angularly without changing their radial and axial locations, as shown in Fig. 12 (Chen et al. 2010). In this particular case, for the cutting structure layout designed for Amin, any three consecutive cutters along the bit profile forms a force balance cutter group. The imbalance force generated by these cutters is minimized and the drilling efficiency improves.</p><div id="link-12">
