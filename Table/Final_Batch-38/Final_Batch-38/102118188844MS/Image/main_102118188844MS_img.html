<p id="Ancr4">The simulation results of NB 35-2 oil field shows that, compared with single huff and puff, multi-well simultaneous steam stimulation has larger gas-swept zone, high pressure and lower viscosity near the wellbore. The numerical results shows as Fig.1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">During field operation process, no gas channeling phenomenon occurred from the injection wells to adjacent wells, which can be observed from Casing Gas production curve of Adjacment well in Fig.2. That means no negative impact on the production wells was induced by the steam injection operation.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">As what is shown in Fig.3, for these two steam injection wells, their daily oil production rate are increased from 28.77 m3/d to 38.87m3/d, and 23.68 m3/d to 35.71 m3/d, respectively. According to the numerical simulation results, the predicted overall incremental oil production amount is about 5250 m3, and the period of validity is about 180 days.</p><div id="link-3">
