<p id="Ancr7">Figure 1 shows a summary of the IOR/EOR projects conducted in Trinidad since the 1940s (Sinanan, Evans, &amp; Budri, 2016). As can be seen from the figure, initially most projects involved gas and water injection. During the late 1960s, produced gas re-injection was the most employed IOR process but once internal gas demand began to increase in the country, gas became a precious commodity and by the end of the 1970s gas injection had stopped altogether.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">As explained by Hosein and co-workers (Hosein, Bertrand, &amp; Dawe, 2011), the reservoirs are mainly composed of highly faulted anticlines resulting from strong tectonic activity during the Miocene/Pliocene. A network of faults (both thrust and normal) break the reservoirs into separate accumulations as illustrated in Figure 4. This heavy faulting is one of the main components of the Trinidad geology that could have a significant impact on the EOR potential and will be addressed below.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The Pelican Lake polymer flood in Canada was the precursor of these developments (Delamaide, Zaitoun, Renard, &amp; Tabary, 2014) and contains some of the highest viscosity oil under polymer flood (Delamaide, 2018); Figure 5 shows the example of a response in a horizontal well under secondary polymer flood in the field (oil viscosity in that area is 1,500 cp). As can be seen from the figure, the well responded to polymer injection by increasing its oil rate from 10 bopd to over 300 bopd. After more than 10 years of injection the well is still producing over 200 bopd. Following these results polymer injection has been expanded to other parts of the field and there are now over 600 wells injecting polymer (Canadian Natural Resources Ltd., 2016), (Cenovus Energy, 2017).</p><div id="link-4">

ASP injection started in 2011 and the response can be seen in Figure 11. Unfortunately, it is impossible to determine what part of the response is due to the fluid injection, to the polymer or to the alkali-surfactant respectively, although the increase in fluid rate that occurred at the same time as the oil response suggests that it is in a large part due to the pressure effect. There was no obvious reduction in water-cut which would be expected if an oil bank had been generated by the chemicals.</p><div id="link-10">
