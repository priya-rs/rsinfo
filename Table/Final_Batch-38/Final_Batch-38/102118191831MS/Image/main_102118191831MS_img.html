<p id="Ancr15">Located in the southern region of Argentina, a large area known as Patagonia comprises three productive hydrocarbon basins, which include the Neuquina (NQN), Golfo San Jorge (GSJ), and Austral (AUT) basins (Fig. 1). The water sources for human use and consumption in Patagonia are rivers and lakes, which are fed by waters traveling from the mountain-chain melting sector; in the same way, this water supply is obtained from phreatic (groundwater) levels. As a clear example, the first hydrocarbon discovery in Argentina was during the search for water for human consumption in Comodoro Rivadavia (GSJ), in which oil was found by chance at a depth of 540 m in December of 1907.</p><div id="link-1">

Some adjustments to the concentration of these crosslinkers were made to obtain a fluid that met the requirement. Additional tests were performed at two lower temperatures (125°F and 100°F) to improve the breaking profile, thereby changing the crosslinkers and breakers. Information on these tests (A, B, and C) is presented in Table 4 and Fig. 4.</p><div id="link-4">

In the beginning, Fluids 2 and 3 presented a high viscosity peak, reflected mainly for the action of XBor-b (high-pH instant boron crosslinkers). These fluids have the highest pH of all systems tested. Fluids 1 and 4 presented lower values and in a similar order to the longer time interval. Additionally, these fluids demonstrated a lower pH for all the systems. For the second time interval evaluated, Fluids 1 and 3 showed a lower viscosity (average of 250 cp) than Fluids 2 and 4 for the same gel loading (25 ppt).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr24">The target for this stage was to perform a group of break tests at different temperatures to obtain a family of fluid formulations with several breaking times, as shown in Table 10 and Fig. 10. These formulations have been used in most of the treatments for both the conventional treatments (100%crosslinked) and the jobs using the hybrid design in vertical and horizontal wells. It is well established that for low temperatures, an expensive enzyme breaker is often applied. The breaker used for this fluid was an oxidizer, which was combined with a catalyst at 100°F to accelerate the breaking time. This breaker and catalyst did not negatively impact the cost of the fluid system.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr25">Fig. 11 presents a slurry-viscosity graph for Fluid 2, in which three periods of time can be identified. The initial period, from 0 to 60 minutes, is called the elastic transport region. During this time, the fluid showed excellent proppant transport capacity, as the proppant was suspended in the fluid. The settlement process began after this initial period, which was identified over a period of 20 minutes (from the 60- to 80-minute mark) and corresponded to the region of viscous settlement. This breaker action weakened the structure-based fracture fluid. Finally, between 80 and 175 minutes, only one proppant decanted, which shows the lack of system structure by the breaker action at that temperature. These tests demonstrated good proppant transport capacity for the evaluated fluid.</p><div id="link-11">
