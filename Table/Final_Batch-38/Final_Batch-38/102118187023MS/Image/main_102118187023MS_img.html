<p id="Ancr1">Tunu is a mature giant gas field, covering an area of 75 km long and 15 km wide at the Eastern limit of Mahakam delta. It consists of enormous multi-layer sand-shale series deposited within a deltaic environment. Discovered in 1977, the production commenced in 1990 and reached peak in 1999 (1.5 Bcfd yearly average – Figure 1). As one of the major gas suppliers in Indonesia, it currently produces around 600 MMscfd with more than 9 Tcf of cumulative gas production.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The field constitutes a series of stacked fluvio-deltaic sand bodies deposited as channel fill or mouth bars lying between surface and 5,000 m subsea. The series are mainly divided into two zones (Figure 2): Tunu Shallow Zone and Tunu Main Zone (TMZ). This paper covers TMZ only which is located between 2,200 to 5,000 mSS. It is vertically divided into six main stratigraphy units (SU), with 300-400 m thickness each. They are bounded by regional maximum flooding surfaces; each of them is refined into 30-50 m thickness sequences bounded by local flooding surfaces which generally act as local seals.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The initial development scheme of the field was based on a regular 1600x1600 m grid well pattern, followed by further grid reduction (1,100 – 800 – 560 and 400 m) in the development evolution of the field. Nearly 1,200 wells have been drilled to date from 34 platforms (Figure 3). The field is now getting mature with denser infill spacing.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">New infill wells had taken an important role in the past few years for sustaining the field potential and maintaining the perforation portfolio. However, finding an attractive new well at this late life of the field has become very challenging. Apart from limited wells resources, current low oil price environment has also led to significant reduction of drilling activities (Figure 4). Therefore, the existing perforation portfolio is becoming the backbone of the field potential and needs to be managed in an efficient and detailed manner.</p><div id="link-4">

At this step, all unperforated reservoirs which can be directly perforated (i.e. not requiring additional job prior to perforation) are compiled together. The database is built specifically to address the objective of the project, and designed to be dynamic in order to accommodate the changes of parameters through the field life.</p><div id="link-5">

Log responses, production history, and sand to sand correlation with surrounding wells (Figure 6) are simultaneously evaluated to determine whether a reservoir can be taken as a future perforation candidate.</p><div id="link-6">

The three main categories are proven gas Non-RP (Non-Reduced Properties - reservoirs with porosity above 10% and netpay above 0.3 m and no presence of water contact insitu), proven gas RP (Reduced Properties – reservoirs outside the criteria of Non-RP), and possible gas (reservoirs with doubtful gas responses).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">Normally, the deepest gas reservoirs are perforated in the first order, and then subsequently followed by more shallow reservoirs once the well production reaches a certain minimum production level. This strategy is, however, adapted on an individual well basis, finetuned based on the risk associated to each reservoir. Good and low risk reservoirs are generally perforated early in the well lifetime, and then followed by more risky perforations. Therefore, most of the wells are assigned with a more flexible bottom-up strategy instead of a strict bottom-up perforation (Figure 9).</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">An efficient and organized reservoir chart has been constructed based on the results of the intensive well review. The chart integrates all future perforation candidates, along with their associated risks and perforation sequences. It enables us to easily monitor evolution of the field perforation portfolio through time. It also allows us to map the distribution of good and poor reservoirs in every platform (Figure 10), which provides a solid basis for optimizing well intervention planning.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">In the new approach, non-candidate reservoirs are excluded. Reservoirs belong to each perforation sequence are deterministically inputted into simulation model based on the results of well review. The time interval between perforation sequences is governed by ‘AutoPerf’ function within the simulator where a new perforation sequence in each well is activated when the well rate reaches a minimum cut- off value (Figure 11). This new approach yields a better representation of the actual operations.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">By having a clear vision on perforation portfolio in every well and platform, well intervention workload in the future can be well anticipated. Combined with the information of the platforms location and well intervention barges availability, it was then used as the basis for developing well intervention operations clustering system. Seven clusters are identified (Figure 12); two clusters in Tunu north and five clusters in Tunu south. Adjacent platforms are normally grouped in one cluster while also ensuring the workload is evenly distributed among the clusters.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">One well intervention barge was assigned in each cluster, except one cluster in South with two barges due to higher perforation portfolio compared to others. This clustering system has improved the efficiency of well intervention operations in which the barges travelling time from one platform to another is reduced. It eventually allows each barge to spend more time for perforation which is reflected by 53% increase of perforation length (Figure 13).</p><div id="link-13">
