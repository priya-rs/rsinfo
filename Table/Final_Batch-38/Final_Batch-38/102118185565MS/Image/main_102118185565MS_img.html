<p id="Ancr12">A set of 391 fields distributed in the 8 more relevant producing oil basins in Colombia were selected for setting up the group of elements for developing the proposed correlation (Figure 1). Subsequently, the fields were handpicked contemplating the fact that the cluster had to surpass 50[%] of the basin production. The distribution of the 51 fields is shown in Table 1, where it can be seen that the total production from them, represents 71.57[%] of 1’020.325, 029 [Bbl/d], which is the Colombia's daily production (ANH, 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr13">The adjustment of each correlation developed with respect to the theoretical data is observed in the Figure 2-6. For every one PVT proposed model was determined: i) R- squared, ii) the absolute error, and iii) and standard error; shown in Table 4. In the previous table is possible to appreciate the different R-squared for each model, which vary from 0.838 to 0.948, indicating a significant adjustment of the data. These results are consistent with those established in the literature for empirical models (i.e. R-square ranges from 0.44 to 0.87) (Dolado, 1999). The range of the data is shown in Table 5.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr18">The comparison of the models is made using a methodology proposed by Ansari (1994), but modifying the studied parameters in order to calculate the relative performance factor. The Figure 7 shows the methodology to carry on, and the equations to estimate the relative performance factor (Frp) are presented below (Equ. 9–17).</p><div id="link-7">
