<p id="Ancr7">The Golfo San Jorge Basin (CGSJ), located in Central Patagonia (Figure 1), can be defined as an intracratonic Basin, extensional, elongated in an E-W direction, bounded by the Macizo Nord Patagónico to the North and the Deseado Region to the south. The main sedimentary fill of the basin was produced during the end of the rifting stages, in the late Jurassic, and in the sag stages in the Cretaceous Period, and finished with an Atlantic Tertiary marine transgression.</p><div id="link-1">

This curve is the sum of the vertical distribution of the different facies (sand / clay) based on the modeling of the different levels. Once the curve was created, we were able to quickly visualize the different sedimentological cycles and adjust the main horizons of the column (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

Curves normalized to the permeabilities of water and oil, can be expressed as a function of: the saturation of water standard Sw*, and the relationship (K/ϕ) NOBP. This simplifies the obtaining of curves corresponding to a zone with a relationship (K/ϕ) NOBP different, given that is not necessary to perform the interpolation between the curves ends.

The 22 years of oil, water and gas production of each of the wells were charged monthly. Water injection began in 2002 (Figure 11). This storical inyection was loaded to the simulator too. This information is the basis for running the first history run. The wells were controlled by liquid. This control allows the model to produce the total liquid of the well in order to control the volumes and thus the behavior of the pressure.</p><div id="link-12">
