<p id="Ancr14">At this point, a reservoir is examined where “too much solute”, asphaltene, was added to the base of the reservoir. This scenario likely resulted from incompatible addition of light and heavy oils in the reservoir. The crest is filled with a low GOR black oil, not with a high GOR fluid, so it is less likely that a gas charge gave rise to the incompatibility. The crest is ten or more kilometers away from the rim of this four way sealing anticline as shown in Fig. 14.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr15">As seen in Fig. 15, the extracted asphaltene content in the core plugs does not vary monotonically with height. This is a two phase system, trapped heavy oil and occluding asphaltene deposition. The changing ratio of asphaltene content from core plugs depends on the fraction of these two phases. Tight streaks in this carbonate reservoir contain more asphaltene; below tight streaks there is more trapped oil.</p><div id="102118181544MS-Img_SPi-15">

<figcaption><b>Figure 15 </b> Asphaltene content from core plugs from whole core taken in tar mat wells. Each point type (green circles, red circles etc.) correspond to one tar well. There is no reflection of the FHZ EoS in any tar well, the asphaltenes are emphatically not equilibrated even over 2 meters of height in the tar wells. This is because the tar is a two phase system, not just a viscous oil. The asphaltene deposition seals off porosity precluding equilibration. The huge range of asphaltene content in core plugs assures that this is not a single phase material.</figcaption>

<p id="Ancr16">Data from two tar wells are plotted in Fig. 16. All components are normalized by the saturates (or paraffins). This normalization is done because otherwise, the other SARA components decrease as the asphaltenes increase from 30% to 60% obscuring the desired effect. As the %-asphaltene increases in the core plug, the plug contains a greater fraction of deposited asphaltene. Fig. 16 shows that only the normalized asphaltene fraction increases with increasing asphaltene deposition, not the resins and not the aromatics.</p><div id="link-16">

[Seifert et al 2012] The SARA components are normalized by saturates to avoid trivial trending of all other components decreasing as asphaltenes increase from 30% to 60%. The tar here is a two phase material. As the asphaltene content increases, the core extracts are more pure with less trapped heavy oil. The normalized asphaltene increases with asphaltene content (of course). However, the normalized resin does not increase. Resin does not preferentially precipitate with the asphaltenes in the deposit. Likewise neither do the aromatics. The deposit is rather high in asphaltene content. [Seifert et al, 2012]</figcaption>
