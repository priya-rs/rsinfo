<p id="Ancr3">Some other minor sands also occur above and below the SC3 sand and are mostly concentrated in the western part of the field. The first discovery well was K-1 which was drilled in 2003 based on the interpretation of year 1988 and 1998 2D seismic lines. In October 2005, K-2 appraisal well (approximately 3.5 km east of K-l well) was drilled to firm up the volumetric assessment of the discovery. In 2006, another appraisal well K-3 was drilled approximately 10 km west of K-l to validate the extension of SC3 sand. This well penetrated the main target SC3 sand at 1005 m MD and shallow secondary reservoirs (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The classical Static P/Z plot at different time spans of the field resulted in different GIIP which was increasing versus time as shown in Figure-2. The early PBU was leading to 250 BScf as GIIP while the later measurements widen the GIIP up to 560 BScf. Thus, the first question was the GIIP value as the main uncertainty in the field. As the field is compartmentalized, only main Fault Block is developed through 5 horizontal wells as shown in Figure-1.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">For data diagnostics the FTHP vs gas production rate of all five wells has been plotted in Figure-3 which confirms good communication through the reservoirs as they follow each other in all transient, quasi-steady-state and Pseudo-Steady-State (PSS) flow regimes. This is a very good indication of reservoir connectivity using purely production data. A simple 2D model was also built based on PTA results and basic reservoir engineering and petrophysical properties like average permeability, thickness, porosity and water saturation.</p><div id="link-3">

In this Figure the Flowing Material Balance (FMB) are shown on the right and Blasingame type curve analysis is on the left. The RTA analysis use Agarwal-Gardner (AG), and Flowing P/Z plot as well as the limited shut in data as plotted in conventional P/Z plots. Well PI, as calculated from flowing pressure data during PSS low regime, is also plotted in the bottom left corner of FMB plot in that Figure.</p><div id="link-5">

This observation validated with the Blasinngame type curve on the right when production data at the same time falls on the boundary dominated flow stem of the curve. We have also checked the radius of investigation and pressure plot using our 2D model which matches well with FMB and Type curve results (Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">We have also looked at the total connected volume to these producers by analyzing the total field production data with the well flowing bottom pressure in RTA. The combined production will point to the total connected volume when FMB are used. Four wells as shown in Figure 8 were used in this analysis. Wells A1 and A2 show a very good match on the straight line analysis with identical gas well productivity index as seen in Figure-7 when the wells were analyzed individually. Well A3 and A4 have also shown a reasonable match with the scattered data and can be addressed by the quality of pressure and rate readings for those particular wells.</p><div id="link-8">
