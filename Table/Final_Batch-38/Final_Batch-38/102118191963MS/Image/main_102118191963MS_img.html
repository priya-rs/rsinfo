<p id="Ancr3">The Cooper Basin is located in central Australia (Fig. 1) and is the largest onshore hydrocarbon producing province in Australia with a cumulative production of approximately 5.4 TCF of gas, 197 MMBBLS oil and 80 MMBBLS of condensation (DSD, 2017). To date the vast majority of these hydrocarbons have been produced from conventional and tight sandstones reservoirs, however as conventional targets mature, exploration emphasis has increasingly moved towards unconventional reservoir exploitation.</p><div id="link-1">

This event marked the end of the Alice Springs Orogeny which was characterised by north-south intraplate compression between the Late Ordovician and the start of the Permian (Haines et al., 2001), although periodic events may have continued through to the Mid-Permian.

<p id="Ancr6">Available palynological data for 107 wells were used to map palynostratigraphic sub-divisions of the Patchawarra Formation using the maximum flooding surface of each sub-division as the mappable surface (Fig. 4). Within the study area, a number of key coal seams meet both minimum thickness and maturity requirements as deep coal gas targets. The V50 coal seam, which is defined by the upper PP2.2.1 palynological zone (Fig. 2), ranges between 16 and 21m thickness and has a measured maturity at wells exceeding Ro 1.1%, making it a prime gas candidate.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The palynologically defined V50 coal was mapped using available 3D and 2D seismic data in the North Patchawarra Trough (Fig. 3) after the generation of well synthetics for the key wells in the study area (Fig. 5). The representative amplitude for the V50, like all coals, is highly variable and "seam splits" are common as a function of varying depositional system. In understanding the variation in fluvial depositional systems, a spectral decomposition time slice at −2131 msec TWT was extracted from the Jonothon and Coolibah 3D volumes, in the centre of the resource area, approximating a time slice just above the V50 coal.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The time slice highlights amplitude and phase at different frequencies to emphasise geomorphologic features which can be interpreted, in conjunction with well and palynological data, as a broad GDE map (Fig. 6). The GDE illustrates a NE-flowing meandering river system and is consistent with walk-out plot interpretations from FMI data at Washington-1, and that coal facies are variably deposited across the trough at different stratigraphic levels. This information is incorporated within the resource model.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">The Patchawarra Formation V50 coal amplitude in the Jonothon and Coolibah 3D surveys was assessed using a maximum amplitude extraction of ±10 ms on the curvature volume (Fig. 8a). The extracted curvature volume shows a number of trends, often in conjugate pairs and with no single constant trend across all volumes. Available FMI data for wells within the volume were assessed and rose plots for fractures in the Permian succession, mainly Patchawarra Formation, are shown in Figure 8b.</p><div id="link-8">
