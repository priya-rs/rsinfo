<p id="Ancr2">Oil was discovered in 1876 but commercial production only began in 1908. Trinidad and Tobago has been involved in the petroleum sector for over one hundred (100) years undertaking considerable oil and gas exploration activity on land and in shallow water with cumulative production totaling over three (3) billion barrels of oil as shown in Figure 1. Proven crude oil reserves in 2013 were estimated at, 728 million barrels according to the Energy Information Administration (EIA) (Ernst &amp; Young 2013)</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">During this period, Trinidad &amp; Tobago has produced approximately 320 million barrels of oil by applying conventional secondary and enhanced oil recovery processes namely water, gas, steam, in-situ combustion, alkaline, polymer, simultaneous water and gas, carbon dioxide, microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR), mixed well steam drive gravity drainage (MWSDD), water alternating steam process (WASP) and downhole electrical heaters. These processes have been predominantly applied onshore south Trinidad, where the vast majority of the island’s oilfields exist, as shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">In conceptualizing a master plan for IOR in Trinidad, it is important to first have an appreciation of the various technologies that have been applied historically. As shown in Figure 3, there have been various types of processes and technologies applied. Many of the projects attempted are no longer in existence today but a few have remained and continue to thrive even in today’s period of low oil prices.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">This trend continued into the 1960’s where the total recovery from gas injection was approximately 4.5 million barrels of oil per year. The number of projects operating continued to steadily increase peaking at thirty-two (32) active projects producing 5.4 million barrels of oil in 1969 as shown in Figure 4 below.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr6">The decline in water injection projects continued and presently there are four (4) active water injection projects in onshore Trinidad &amp; Tobago located in the Apex/Quarry, Bennett Village, Morne Diablo and Moruga West fields. Despite the limited number of active water injection projects and historical challenges, water injection has been an extremely successful form of improved oil recovery in Trinidad &amp; Tobago accounting for approximately 125 million barrels of oil since inception as shown in Figure 5</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Much of the production gained during the simultaneous injection was attributed to the water injected and many were eventually reverted to water injection, having recovered 3.6 million barrels of oil. Figure 7 below shows a summary of the performance of the simultaneous water and gas injections projects in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The interest in the use of carbon dioxide to improve oil recovery was revived in 2009 by Krishna Persad &amp; Associates Limited. The company embarked on a small carbon dioxide huff ‘n’ puff project in the Barrackpore farmout. The results obtained have been quite modest. Figure 8 below shows the total performance of carbon dioxide projects in Trinidad &amp; Tobago.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">Comparing the operational practices between low and high success areas has shown that water chemistry/specification is the biggest problem. Researchers and operators today are putting more effort into the technologies of water chemistry, filtration and pumping. The various categories of chemical flooding, as shown in Figure 9, address the issue of mobility and hence sweep efficiency but have always been hampered by cost and pore-volume contact.</p><div id="link-9">
