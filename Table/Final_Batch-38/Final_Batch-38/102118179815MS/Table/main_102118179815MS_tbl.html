However, it was also found that changing the downhole steam quality (within the range considered) has a minimum impact in the cumulative production. Table 1 lists the range of uncertainty parameters and the values for the optimized case. It should be noted that except for the RelPerm set, all optimal values lie well within the range considered; therefore, widening the range of investigation was not required.</p><p><b>Table 1</b> Uncertainty parameters (with ranges) and their values for the optimized case</p><p>Table 1 Uncertainty parameters (with ranges) and their values for the optimized case</p><table id="102118179815MS-Tbl_SPi-1" frame="hsides">

To utilize the OSR comparison it is important to note that prior to solvent injection and bitumen uplift there is a period in which the pad operation suffered from unstable production and injection, which represents a noisy OSR signal, as shown in Figure 14. Hence, the OSR comparison will be made neglecting this period. Table 2 and Table 3 show the results of OSR comparisons and bitumen uplift, respectively, utilizing the two methods described above.

Figure 8a shows the cumulative solvent produced during the pilot for the different algorithms. As can be seen, there is a large variation amongst all of the algorithms which is mainly due to the different assumptions made in each method (Table 4). To narrow this uncertainty it is necessary to screen out some of these methods based on their assumptions and compositional information collected through sampling.</p><p><b>Table 4</b> Description of solvent splitting algorithms [1]</p><p>Table 4 Description of solvent splitting algorithms [1]</p><table id="102118179815MS-Tbl_SPi-4" frame="hsides">
