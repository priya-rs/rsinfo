<p id="Ancr7">Measurement of production was divided into emulsion production and casing vent gas (CVG), as shown in Figure 3 and is explained in more detail in [1]. Production of the emulsion line was measured during well tests in a two phase gas-liquid separator. The gross rate and water cut of the emulsion was measured using in-line meters. Note that proportional samples were taken for hydrocarbon composition and water cut verification; in addition, the gross rate of the emulsion production of the whole pad was also measured and sampled through the group header (EGH).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr10">The CVG reconciliation was only possible for the four wells that were re-routed through the three phase separator (p6, p10, p11, and p19); however the conclusions can be extrapolated to the other producers. Note that these wells were selected since solvent production breakthrough was detected in these producers. The first comparison relates to the amount of water rates in the CVG, as shown in Figure 6a. In this case, the amount of water measured in the separator is compared to the summation of the individual well water rates. Estimation of the latter is based on the assumption that the CVG gas is fully saturated with water; the water fraction on the stream is calculated using Raoult’s law and the molecular weight of the hydrocarbons obtained by sampling.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr12">The other four have been developed in-house. a detailed description of the algorithms can be found in the Appendix A. Figure 8a shows the cumulative solvent produced during the pilot for the different algorithms. As can be seen, there is a large variation amongst all of the algorithms which is mainly due to the different assumptions made in each method (Table 4). To narrow this uncertainty it is necessary to screen out some of these methods based on their assumptions and compositional information collected through sampling.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr16">It is important to note that production of the individual wells is not always matched completely. That results in differences in production timing and hence the observable discrepancies in the rate plot. A good example is the soak radial producer p11 and the adjacent vertical infill well p19. The rate plots for these wells as well as the combined rates are shown in Figure 12. For most of the time bitumen production from p11 is under predicted by 10m3/day approximately and bitumen production from p19 is over predicted by almost the same amount. The combined error in cumulative bitumen production is less than 2.5%. This shows that while the connections between steam injectors and individual producer are not perfectly matched in the model, the performance is very well matched on a pattern basis.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr17">The allocation of p6 is uncertain; on the one hand, according to field data, well p6 shows solvent production as early as a month after start of solvent injection, which proves that p6 is connected to one of the solvent patterns. On the other hand, the produced solvent to bitumen ratio for this well is lower than any of the other solvent producer wells which indicate that p6 may be receiving only partial support from the solvent injectors. To account for this uncertainty, a range of possible p6 splits is taken into account, as shown in Figure 13. Three cases are considered, low, mid, and high, in which well p6 belongs to the solvent pattern on a 25, 50, and 75% split, respectively.</p><div id="link-13">

To utilize the OSR comparison it is important to note that prior to solvent injection and bitumen uplift there is a period in which the pad operation suffered from unstable production and injection, which represents a noisy OSR signal, as shown in Figure 14. Hence, the OSR comparison will be made neglecting this period. Table 2 and Table 3 show the results of OSR comparisons and bitumen uplift, respectively, utilizing the two methods described above.

<p id="Ancr19">Finally, the history matched model was assessed in view of solvent recovery. Moreover, the capability of the model to predict the solvent recovery was also tested by extrapolating the HM model from April to December and comparing this with the measured solvent recovery, and running the simulation with the total gross rate production as a well constraint. Figure 15 shows the comparison of the solvent recovery measured (with uncertainties) and the history matched and predicted values from the sector model. As can be seen, the model was able to history matched the solvent recovery values and the predicted values are well in line with the measured values (cumulative error less than 2%).</p><div id="link-15">
