<p id="Ancr1">TBA Field is an offshore field located within Salawati Kepala Burung Block, West Papua Province, Indonesia (Figure 1). It was discovered in 1975, first production started in 2006 by use of Floating Production Storage &amp; Offloading (FPSO). This field consists of two active wells that is TBA-3 and TBA-4 with potential reserves of 9.020 MMBO and Estimated Ultimate Recovery (EUR) is 4.328 MMBO. TBA-3 stop produces on November 2007 with last production rate of 337 BOPD.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The production of oil originated from reef build up carbonate reservoir with thickness from 10 to 60 ft. The depths ranging average between 6900 ft to 7200 ft, porosity 14-25% from core data and log data, water saturation of 20%. The API of oil is 52 with average GOR 3300 scf/bbl. Figure 2 shows there are four wells had been drilled in TBA Field which is two explorations wells (TBA-1, TBA-2) and two developments well (TBA-3) and (TBA-4). Based on material balance evaluation (Figure 3), the drive mechanisms of TBA Field are combination of water drive, solution gas drive, and fluid expansion system.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">TBA-2X was the first well in TBA Field which had been drilled and tested in 1974. Based on test result from interval 6,904 – 6,970 ft of Upper Kais formation indicated a good result with delivery of 7.35 million cubic feet gas and 1,204 barrel condensate per day. Significant result was present at interval 7,050 – 7,228 ft which could produce 2,049 BOPD. Oil Water Contact (OWC) was confirmed at 7,277 ft TVDSS (Figure 4). In 2004, TBA-3 was drilled and tested at 7,394 – 7,444 ft which delivered 4,789 BOPD and 3.09 MMSCFD.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">TBA field was put on stream in 2006 with initial production of 2,143 BOPD from TBA-4. In the next days, TBA-3 was opened giving an additional production of 2,000 BOPD with 0% watercut. This field reached peak production on March 14, 2007 at 5,613 BOPD. Afterward, fluid started to decline while watercut increasing. As the result, oil production declined significantly to 1,250 BOPD in 2010 (Figure 5). There were two causes, first, TBA-3 was stop producing on November 24, 2007 due to depleted reservoir pressure.</p><div id="link-5">

There is two wellheads, one production manifold, and one control panel (Figure 6). The fluid from TBA-3 and TBA-4 are commingling through production manifold before being transferred to processing facilities at FPSO via 6 inches production riser.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">At FPSO, the crudes go to high-pressure separator. The gas will be separated from the liquid and flow to the high-pressure knockout drum before going to flare stack. After passing the first, the liquid will be introduced to low-pressure separator. The oils then enter electric coalescer and crude stabilizer for better water separation while the gas will go to low-pressure knockout drum. During reactivation, a gas compressor and 3 inches gas injection line from FPSO to the platform were installed to provide gas lift system (Figure 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Based on field reactivation program, TBA Field was planned to use gas lift and FPSO. Luckily, TBA-4 and TBA-3 were already equiped with gas lift downhole equipments. For TBA-4, gas lift valve and orifice were placed at 2,956 ft and 6,457 ft respectively. While for TBA-3, it were placed at 2,968 ft and 6,426 ft (Figure 8). Gas lift system is closed loop system; where associate gas after production separator being piped to the suction of the compressor station then the discharged gas is injected back to the well to lift the fluids from the well.</p><div id="link-8">
