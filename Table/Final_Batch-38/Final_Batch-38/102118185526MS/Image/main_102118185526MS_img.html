<p id="Ancr2">The pilot involves nine wells with completions only in the Rayoso Fm. It has three central producing wells (PP-1, PP-2 and PP-3) surrounded by six polymer injectors (PI-1 to PI-6) in a line-drive scheme with an average distance of 160 m between injectors and producers (Figure 1). Because the second-line wells continue to produce/inject in the three formations, allocation of the fluids is considered one of the key aspects to defining the success of the project.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Figure 3 shows cumulative tracer recovery as a fraction of the injected mass. These connections also contributed significantly to the cumulative tracer amounts. There are also two smaller events characterized by early breakthrough times (around 90 days), small peak concentrations and very small cumulative tracer recovery. Therefore both of these high-conductivity connections probably involve very small reservoir volumes and should not affect the overall sweep efficiency of the baseline waterflood and subsequent polymer flood.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Figure 4 shows three horizon slices extracted from a discontinuity attribute cube. Horizon slices (b) and (c) show some features with west to east direction in the center and in the south zone of the pilot. Such features could be interpreted as structural lineaments or faults and therefore possible barriers to flow. However, these features are only seen within the Rayoso Fm. interval, meaning subseismic fault-throw and uncertain implications for reservoir connectivity, therefore they were not included in the first 3D model.</p><div id="link-4">

It can be seen that Rayoso Fm. and Agrio Fm. oil have the same background and that Hutrín Fm. has a completely different kind of oil. Rayoso and Agrio oils can be discriminated due to the alteration of the oil resulting from biodegradation and evaporation, which has been severe to highly severe in the case of Rayoso Fm. losing most of the iso-components in the gasoline range.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr10">The results are shown on Figure 9 as a time series from left to right. Date, fluid type, injection rate and wellhead pressure values are indicated on top of each profile. During water injection the injection profile was that of the first plot to the left, with the 10-meter perforated interval between 587 and 597 m taking between 60% and 70% of the injected water. This flow distribution was almost unchanged since April 2015. Polymer injection in the test at the initial rate of 50 m3/d notably changed the inflow distribution, with 100%intake into the second interval from top, followed by a more even distribution at the intermediate injection rate, and turning back to the initial profile at the highest rate of 100 m3/d.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr11">The production phase was an important part of the test because of the information collected on polymer solution integrity after being transported into the reservoir and back-produced. The well was put in production with a PCP pump for about one month, during which time the produced fluid was sampled at 1 or 2-hour intervals to measure viscosity and polymer concentration. The results are shown in Figure 10, in a plot of polymer concentration and solution viscosity as measured in the field laboratory on produced fluid samples taken at the wellhead.</p><div id="102118185526MS-Img_SPi-10">

<p id="Ancr13">This target has been met so far, but the results still do not show well-established trends. We can consider that two or three out of six injection wells in the pilot have improved their vertical conformance. Small changes detected in many intervals in the flow profiles are believed not to be real changes but a consequence of the measurement uncertainty. As an example, Figure 12 shows the evolution in the injection profile for the well PI-3, showing reproducibility of the profiles during polymer injection. Showing vertical conformance improvement.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr14">A modified Hall Plot (Buell et al. 1990) was used for all the wells to monitor injectivity changes. As an example Figure 13 shows the result obtained for the well PI-3, in which a different slope for each concentration can be identified. The baseline of injectivity corresponds to the blue curve, it is followed by the red curve at 400 ppm polymer concentration, then the green curve at 800 ppm polymer concentration and finally by the purple line corresponding to 1200 ppm polymer concentration. Each change in polymer concentration correlates to a slope change that is an indicator of injectivity decrease.</p><div id="link-13">
