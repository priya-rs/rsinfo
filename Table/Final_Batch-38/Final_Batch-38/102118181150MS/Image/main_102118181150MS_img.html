<p id="Ancr17">The G field is a mature heavy oil field in Ecuador which started producing in 1996. The initial development plan included drilling horizontal wells through M1 sandstone, which is a high permeability reservoir, to increase drainage area and improve sweep efficiency of heavy oil that is produced under a regional water drive mechanism (see figure 10).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr18">As an alternative, active inflow control devices (AICD) allows equalizing the influx of oil and waterby creating additional backpressure in zones that produces at higher rates. Heavy oil takes a relatively nonrestrictive path while water or gas (lower viscosity fluid) flows through a tortuous path causing a decrease in its flow rate; thus, improving recovery efficiency and increasing NPV (see figure 11).</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr20">On the other hand, real time monitoring of ESP performance allows measuring pump efficiency and energy consumption (Kwh); some criteria with three ranges were defined to determine the proper consumption of energy. Based on this analysis, it is possible to determine automatically how efficient the oil production rate is in a well, as compared to the energy consumption required to generate this production. Therefore, it is possible to determine which wells are working ineficienlly, and eventually, when they would need an intervention to repair or replace its ESP (see Figure 13).</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr21">Production deferment average rates in Jibaro, Jibarito and Yanayacu fields exceeds 7%. An implementation of a real-time monitoring program + an automatic ESP production performance system would be useful to reduce downtime production, enhance runlife of ESP pumps (currently in 700 days), as well as, to assure that pump performance keeps at proper design parameters.

For instance, in one of the horizontal wells of Yanayacu, there were identified 6 zones with potential use of AICD. that would be isolated with 7 packers.

According to annual report of reserves @ Dic-2015, there is almost 14 MMSTB of proved undeveloped reserves that can be added to proved developed figures with horizontal wells in Jibaro and Jibarito fields (see figure 17); thus, recovery factor can increase by almost 3% (see table 7).</p><div id="link-17">
