<p id="Ancr2">The study area, referred to as the C Block, is located in the middle of Bowen Basin and included the interpretation of 180 wells with geophysical log data which were unevenly distributed in a 3D seismic volume of 51 km2 (Fig. 1-a). The RCM were targeted for this study. They are a middle-rank coal seam gas target with high gas contents and low permeability. The main coal plies in the block are R1 and R2 at the top and R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 at the middle, with the Girrah seam at the base.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The majority of wells have only been drilled deep enough to intersect the R1 and R2 coal seam, and only a small amount of wells has been drilled through to the Girrah seam (Fig. 1). From the well correlation section (Fig. 2), coal seams R1 and R2 are spatially more continuous with total thickness approximately 5 m. Other coal seams such as R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9 and R10 are less continuous with numerous merges and pinch-out features. Several seismic attributes, such as strong amplitude and frequency, have been used to map out the distribution of sandstone channels. Two distinctive channel groups can be distinguished, one coming from the north and one coming from the south (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Normalization was performed on a number of wells which had density values that exceeded the normal range. The cross plots in Fig. 5 shows that the sonic and density have a strong relationship. The coal cut off value identified from other lithology can be obtained by using the lithology data in the cross plot and histogram figures of P-impedance and density. For coal, the P-impedance cut off value is set to be less than 5*106 kg/m3, and density cut off value is less than 1.8 g/cc (Fig. 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">A cross plot analysis of the average error by step-wise regression methods was used to decide the best number of attributes and which of the attributes were to use for the density inversion in Fig. 6. Additionally, the predicted and actual curves for each well were compared after probabilistic neural network computation to check the reliability of the results (Fig. 7). The resulting density cubes included the overburden zone which was calculated by well data interpolation in consideration of GIS overlays. The velocity model was then calculated by dividing the P-impedance model with the density model.</p><div id="link-7">

In Well L, the simulated principal stress has a northeast-southwest orientation which is consistent with BI data of this well. 2D stress simulation on the R1 and R2 coal seams showed that the direction of principal stress of the study area is predominantly in a north-east to south-west direction. The direction of principal stress can be used to predict the fracture deformation directions.</p><div id="link-9">

Once the density volume had been trimmed, the overburden pressure could be calculated by integrating the density volume. Fig. 10 shows that Pov is influenced not only by the ground elevation, but also by the monocline structure. The Pov in south area is less than 6 Mpa, but as the depth increases, the pressure exceeds 10 Mpa, maxing out at approximately 13 Mpa.</p><div id="link-10">
