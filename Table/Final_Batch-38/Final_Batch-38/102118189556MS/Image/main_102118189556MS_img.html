<p id="Ancr1">The produced oil is exported via pipeline to an oil terminal, and exported via shuttle tanker to the market. The produced gas is re-injected into the reservoir for pressure support and gas storage. The field achieved first oil production in December 2013, and had produced 43 MMSTB of crude oil as at December 2016 (13% current oil recovery factor). Figure 1 shows Field E’s top Turonian reservoir depth structure map and well locations.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Figure 2 is a North-South schematic section of the Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs in the region between Cote d’Ivoire and Nigeria. Field E’s hydrocarbon fluids are located in the low permeability, unconsolidated Turonian sandstone reservoir formation, and the fluids are most likely sourced from Cenomanian and Albian black shales. The Turonian formation is of Upper Cretaceous age, underlies the prolific Tertiary formation seen in Nigeria’s Niger Delta oil fields, and was deposited in a turbidite environment.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The nine development wells were fitted with 13Cr 5.5 inch tubings and permanent downhole gauges. The five production wells were also fitted with gas lift valves for artificial lift and chemical injection valves for scale and hydrate management. Sand screens were installed in all of the nine wells for sand control, and typical lower completion lengths range from 2000 to 3000 feet measured depth. Figure 3 shows some examples of sand control solutions used in the petroleum industry.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The development wells were drilled from an offshore platform which can process 120 000 stock tank barrels per day (stb/d) of liquids, 100 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCF/D) of gas, and 200 000 stb/d of water injection. Figure 4 shows typical offshore platforms used to produce oil and gas in the petroleum industry. The produced water is treated on Field E’s production platform and disposed overboard. Field E’s produced water rate is expected to rise over time because water injection is now the dominant reservoir drive mechanism in the field.</p><div id="link-4">
