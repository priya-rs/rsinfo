<p id="Ancr1">Attempts to prolong economic field life of mature assets triggered the popularity of infill drilling and multizone completions. Comingled production from numerous reservoirs is more challenging for scale and paraffin control. Additional challenges presented are the extent of the development area and high well population. ConocoPhillips (COP) alone has 4,300 active wells spread over 18 counties and (Figure 1) produce over 60 MBOE daily. With such high production volumes, areal spread and numerous downhole challenges the Permian basin needs a cost effective chemical management program.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The first attempt to verify the severity of scaling in the field was to set up and run scale prediction models using existing, optimistic ICP analysis. Every water sample used in the analysis was quality checked for the mass balance (bicarbonates, etc.) and then assigned to corresponding producing formations. The scale prediction was sensitized using variation in temperature and pressure with depth, shown in Figure 2, with various formations/zones listed on x-axis.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Precipitation of paraffin and asphaltenes in the Permian basin costs operators millions of dollars annually through lowering production, increasing downtime due to wax remedial jobs, and use of expensive chemicals. The studies2 performed in the late 1990’s confirms that Permian operators perform little if any up-front planning or testing prior to initiating paraffin-control programs. Any necessity for remedial treatments such as bullheading of aromatic or proprietary blends usually indicates a deficiency in the prevention strategy, Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">Unless instructed, the pump shops may not always provide the samples to the chemical representative thus critical information about downhole deposition issues is lost. The same is true when rods and tubing are pulled. Samples should be collected if solid deposition is evident. In an effort to improve the rod pump service quality, the selection of vendors with outstanding performance history and an established rod pump maintenance database helps track the number of samples collected and facilitates the exchange of information with chemical vendors. Figure 4 shows deposits collected from production equipment.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">In this case, the first action is to investigate the water source, and evaluate potential methods to shut it off by means of a cross-linked polymer gel, squeeze cementing, etc. Since the well is not flowing, the only way to understand the fluid source is to collect the water sample, analyze it, and compare with ICP signatures – baselines established for individual zones. Such signatures were estab-lished in the scope of this study and displayed in the bar charts of Figure 5.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">To eliminate the problem of erroneous data entries, the creation of a vendor portal was necessary. This portal allows the chemical vendor to upload treatment data in spreadsheet format to a website which either accepts or rejects the data based on governance rules. If the data is accepted, it is mapped to the proper tables and stored for analysis. If the data is rejected, Excel highlights the data which is incorrect or missing and sends it back to the vendor for resubmission. This process is highlighted in Figure 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">These visualizations can also be used to calculate an efficiency index for continuous treatments by taking the reporting period (days) minus the sum of time intervals with the injection concentration below target (days). This value is then divided by the total injection time (days). For batch or periodic treatments, the calculation is similar except the efficiency index is the planned treatment frequency (days) divided by the actual treatment frequency (days). These indices provide a quantifiable means of measuring deviation from the planned treatment schedule and can also be plotted as a separate graph over time as in Figure 9 and 10.</p><div id="link-9">
