<p id="Ancr1">In 2012, natural gas accounted for more than 20% of the global primary energy mix (IEA, 2014). Most long-range forecasts expect its share of the primary energy mix to continue to rise (IEA, 2014; EIA, 2015; BP, 2015). Today, natural gas is recovered from conventional reservoirs – in isolation or dissolved in oil – and from unconventional reservoirs, in which buoyancy forces are insufficient to make the gas flow, and intervention is required to produce hydrocarbons to the surface. But natural gas can also be found in gas-hydrate accumulations (figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">This is primarily because of the high permeability and porosity of these formations, which enable high concentrations of gas hydrates to form, and facilitate recovery (Boswell et al., 2014). By contrast, both academics and corporate players have lost interest in producing from gas-hydrate resources in disseminated, low concentration clay-dominated sediments, or from sparse, small and randomly occurring seafloor mounds. Even though clay-rich deposits account for the bulk of gas-hydrate resources (Figure 1 and 2), they would require wholly different approaches to production and are as different to sand-hosted hydrates as shale gas is to conventional gas (Boswell et al., 2011a).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Contrary to common belief, exploration is not a major hurdle in the development of gas-hydrate resources (Figure 3). Thanks to a better understanding of the properties of gas hydrates and their responses to seismic and electromagnetic signals (made possible largely by additional field data from drilling campaigns), conventional technologies, with minor modifications, have proved effective in identifying and characterizing gas-hydrate deposits.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">These issues are familiar to the oil and gas industry, but their convergence creates a unique challenge that may threaten the economic viability of gas-hydrate recovery. Another threat relates to uncertainties concerning geomechanical stability and subsidence arising from prolonged gas-hydrate production (Moridis et al, 2011). Respondents to the SBC-EI survey (2015) ranked the most significant challenges in production as the geomechanical instability of reservoirs and subsidence caused by hydrate dissociation (figure 4). These findings underscore the need for long-duration production tests.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The response of natural gas hydrates to climate change has only been investigated recently, and modelling in this field is in its infancy and subject to considerable uncertainties. Nevertheless, it is generally agreed that natural gas-hydrate dissociation is likely to be a regional phenomenon, rather than a global one, and is more likely to occur in subsea permafrost and upper continental shelves than in deep-water reservoirs, which make up the majority of gas hydrates (Reagan et al., 2013; Ruppel, 2011), (figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">As shown in the SBC-EI patent analysis (2015), with 191 patents filed between 1960 and 2013, China has also become the most active patent-filing country for gas-hydrate upstream technologies following a sharp increase in patenting rates since the late 2000s (figure 6). Meanwhile patenting activity has remained steady in the U.S. (180 patents as of December 31st 2013), and has declined in Europe and the former Soviet Union. Many countries have also announced their ambition to carry out additional production tests.</p><div id="link-6">

After having conducted the world’s first offshore depressurization test, in 2013, in Nankai Trough, Japan is now hoping to start commercial production by the end of this decade (JOGMEC, 2013).
