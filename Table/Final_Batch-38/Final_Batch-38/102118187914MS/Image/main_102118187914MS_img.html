<p id="Ancr4">Novoportovskoe field was discovered on December 24, 1964, by a gas spouter obtained from exploration well R-50 with a daily production rate of over 1 million cubic meters. Novoportovskoe oil, gas and condensate field is located in the south-east of the peninsula, 250 km north of the town of Nadym, 30km away from the coast of the Gulf of Ob on the Yamal Peninsula and belongs to West Siberian Oil and Gas Province (Fig. 1). Due to logistical, climatic and technological difficulties, a full-scale production drilling commenced only in 2014.</p><div id="link-1">

Yu2-6 formation is the most interesting in terms of its development in the Jurassic sequence section. The oil-saturated thickness of the horizon is 40 m (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The first campaign in multistage hydraulic fracturing started at Novoportovskoe field in 2015. Based on the results, the problem of a breakthrough into the gas horizon as well as a significant water encroachment of the influx was clearly identified. A high gas ratio (more than 1000 m3/t while planned rate is110 m3/t) and water cut of more than 50% (Fig. 3) were received at the majority the wells treated. Such parameters clearly indicate the involvement of gas and water-bearing formations, which leads not only to the reduction of well productivity but also to an additional load onto the field infrastructure (the necessity to utilize gas and water).</p><div id="link-3">

Generally, concluding from the study data analysis, the port location in a more shales interval leads to an increased risk of fracture breakthrough into gas/water-bearing intervals. It is also important to note the inevitability of fracture breakthrough into the water-bearing horizon; however, its involvement degree highly depends on the port location (Fig. 15).</p><div id="link-15">

This resulted in a sufficient increase in well productivity; the comparison of barrels of oil per day is shown in Fig. 17. Well A, where multistage hydraulic fracturing was performed without breaks and with gel loading of 2.0 kg/m3, demonstrates a significantly higher performance comparing to Well Z, where using the conventional injection technique, fracturing fluid of the previous stage had to be utilized in the fracture and the gel loading was 2.8 kg/m3.</p><div id="link-17">
