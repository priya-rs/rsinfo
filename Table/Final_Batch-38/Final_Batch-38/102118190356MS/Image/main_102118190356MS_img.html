<p id="Ancr1">The map of the field is presented in Fig. 1 above. Most oil producers are activated with Gas Lift, therefore gas compression is available on the offshore platforms. Since the reservoir is currently quite depleted (50 to 80 bar depending on location, from 120 bar initially), the gas network pressure is just sufficient to inject into the reservoir, allowing for a low cost gas injection pilot using the Huff and Puff technique. The oil producer SEM1-13 was chosen to be the central well of this pilot, but the effect of the gas injected at SEM1-13 is being monitored at the distant wells. Preparation work included 3 main steps:</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Cycle 1 was started in May 2015, with a 2 week injection period at a small gas injection rate of 5 kSm3/d, followed by a 1 week soaking period, and then the well was reopened, started with gas-lift, and produced for a 4 week production period. A slight increase of the liquid rate was observed in production, but it just compensated the duration during which the well had been injecting or shut-in. Production was then stopped for one week to measure a pressure buildup using the downhole gauge (called Well test in Fig. 2). The derivative plot of this pressure transient analysis is displayed in Fig. 5 below.</p><div id="link-2">

The PI for the reference cycle (0) was 2.5 m3/d/bar, whereas for cycles 1 and 2 it was on average respectively 40% and 60% higher. A similar plot could have been made in terms of oil PI, with an even stronger increase over the reference cycle.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The bottomhole sampling was performed during cycle 0 using slack line, one sample was filled with water but the second sample had 50 cm3 of oil (out of 600 cm3), which allowed the compositional analysis of the 2015 pre-pilot oil composition of SEM1-13. Fig. 4 below shows a comparison with the oil composition on that well dating from 2004, and with the oil composition from the nearby well SEM2-12 used for PVT swelling experiment.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">We started from the analysis of the PVT swelling experiment, which had been performed with oil sampled in 2012 on a nearby well SEM2-12. Results are shown in Fig. 7, the blue diamonds being measured viscosities. This experiment allowed to calibrate the interaction between the viscous oil and injected gas, and allowed to constrain the equation of state. It predicts a modest decrease of the oil viscosity by 1/3 only for a reservoir pressure around 60 bar.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">The MCT results in Fig. 8 a) show that the oil viscosity would have continued to decrease below 30-35 bar, to values around 25 bar, after 3 pore volumes injected. We also performed a sensitivity on the richness of the gas, and for a richer gas (24% mol of C3-C5), the oil viscosity could decrease stronger and quicker to 10-15 cp only after about 2 pore volumes injected, still at 60 bar. A last sensitivity was performed at the value of the pressure, showing that at a higher pressure, the oil-gas interaction would be a bit stronger, but that the effect of the injected gas composition was predominant. The same holds for the oil formation volume factor (Bo), plotted in Fig. 8 b), which increases more when injected gas is richer, and also when operating pressure is higher.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">These multi-contact simulations could seem speculative, but they were indeed quite enlightening and useful, and without them it would not have been possible to explain the good results in terms of oil productivity index observed in the near wellbore region. Our understanding is that the mechanism is mainly a condensing gas drive, with intermediate components (C3 to C5) going into solution more easily than light components (C1 and C2). This can be modeled with a backward multi-contact test, shown in Fig. 9, illustrating that the excess gas after 50 multi-contact steps has lost (red arrow) most of its C3-C5, while the oil after 100 multi-contact steps has gained (green arrow) a lot of the C3-C5 components, which are very efficient in lowering the viscosity. This implies that deviscosification near the gas injection point is stronger than in the region far away from this injection point, where gas will be leaner.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">Still using this MCT approach, and its simulated effect on Bo, as per Fig. 8b), we estimated the 1D gas efficiency, assuming that all extra oil swelling was giving extra oil production, plotted in Fig. 10. We then compared it with the field data: as stated above for the observed rates during cycle 2, considering a 9 week period (2 inj+ 1 soaking + 6 production), the oil rate increased by 31 – 23 = 8 Sm3/d for 6 weeks, while the gas injected was 20 kSm3/d for 2 weeks.</p><div id="link-10">

The match is not perfect, but it is better than in Fig. 11, and reproduces more or less the rate increase observed at SEM1-13 after each gas injection and soaking, and it is compatible with the gas breakthrough times suspected at the the remote producers.</p><div id="link-12">
