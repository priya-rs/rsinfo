<p id="Ancr10">Based on the country-wide EOR screening study, Raudhatain Zubair (RAZU) was identified as a potential ASP (Alkaline Surfactant Polymer) EOR target. The Raudhatain field is located in North Kuwait and it consists of multiple stacked sand stone reservoirs (Figure 1). This field was discovered in 1955 and has been on continuous production since 1960 (Abdul Azim et. al., 2006). The RAZU formation is the deepest of three major oil producing reservoirs in the large dome anticline (Nemcsok et. al., 2006).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr11">Aerially the reservoir was divided into 6 sectors as shown in Figure 2 below. A semi-quantitative approach was chosen to rank each of the 6 areas for suitability of pilot execution. The selection criteria incorporated a detailed look at STOIIP and remaining oil for EOR, waterflood maturity and sweep efficiency, oil production and water cut, formation properties, sample availability for laboratory calibration, representativeness of area for full-field application, well density, faults and compartmentalization, surface facilities congestion and surface facilities readiness to receive ASP produced oil. Due to the higher density of faults and higher surface footprint in the southern and western quadrants of the field, the decision was taken to select the pilot location in Areas 1 and 2 of Figure 2 below.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr12">The Raudhatain Zubair field is highly dissected by many faults (over 36 main faults). Most of the faults are concentrated on the southern and western quadrants of the field as shown in Figure 3 below. In general, very few faults are connected. However, this doesn’t eliminate the risk of compartmentalization with respect to the sub seismic faults since the stratigraphic sequence contains high density of shale streaks. A small fault throw can disconnect the sands and create baffles due to juxtaposition or shale smearing along the fault surface.</p><div id="link-3">

Available SCAL data as shown in Figure 4 below was reviewed and compared with the relative permeabilities from the previously history-matched KOC Eclipse model. Due to the limited Relative Permeability SCAL data available from RAZU UZSD, Shell proprietary tool “RELATE” was used to generate relative permeability ranges based on Shell’s analog sandstone database for similar formations in Middle East region. However, in the end the decision was made to stay with measured SCAL data from the field.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr16">The current average pressure of Upper Zubair Sand in Areas 1 and 2 of UZSD Zubair 46 channel (Z46CH) area is estimated to be around 3625 psia. This is based on the available Static BHP and Repeat Formation Tester (RFT) data. As shown in Figure 7 below, the annual pressure drop in the pilot area historically ranged from 5.2 psia/year to 39.3 psia/year. Based on this understanding, the sector model was initialized at 3625 psi and boundary conditions were applied such that average pressure drop per year was stable between 5.2 and 39.3 psia/year as shown in Figure 7 below. A sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate impact of different pressure decline rates on the model which showed minimal impact of pressure decline on incremental recovery from ASP.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr19">The idealized pattern recovery factor and average oil saturation in the pattern after ASP flood is shown in Figure 10 below. It can be observed from the results that oil saturation in the pilot area reduces to Sorw (i.e. 30%) within 1.5 years of pre-flush water injection. After 0.3 PV of chemical injection and chasing slug with polymer, oil saturations were reduced to around 5% in the pilot pattern area within another 1.5 years. This prediction is an ultimate recovery based on top quartile chemical performance and low areal heterogeneities due to small pilot pattern size.</p><div id="link-10">

Minimizing the time to evaluate pilot performance became a driver in for the project. Different pilot pattern sizes were evaluated to assess the effect of heterogeneity on performance. The oil desaturation and oil recovery for the pilot pattern sizes evaluated is shown in Figure 16 below. For a 0.5-1.5 Acre inverted 5-spot pattern, average oil saturation of the pattern is reduced to less than 10% within one year after 0.3 PV ASP injection followed by polymer chase injection.

<p id="Ancr29">To understand the efficiency of pattern types, Oil chemical ratios for regular and inverted 5-spot patterns were compared as shown Figure 20 below. It can be observed that the Inverted 5-spot pattern is more efficient in mobilizing the oil from the pilot area to the producers compared to regular 5-spot pattern for similar volumes and rates of fluid injected.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr30">This can be explained further by comparison of the oil desaturation after ASP slug injection for both pattern types as shown in Figure 21 below. The inverted 5-spot pattern shows higher desaturation than the regular 5-spot pattern in the pilot pattern area, mainly due to injection lost to area outside the pilot for the regular 5-spot pattern.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr31">Injection rate or injection volume per year is a measure of the speed at which pattern area is being swept. The range of injection/production rates that was evaluated for the pilot pattern was 500 bpd to 5000 bpd with 1600 bpd as reference case (Voidage Replacement Ratio, VRR=1). For low injection rate of 500 bpd, oil desaturation is very slow. For the high injection rate of 5000 bpd, oil saturation is quite rapid reducing to almost 5% within 1 year after ASP slug was injected. The comparison of oil desaturation is shown in Figure 22 below.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr33">Injecting too much polymer will not continue to improve the displacement efficiency for a given pore volume injected. Figure 24 below shows that there is a noticeable reduction in remaining oil saturation on increasing the viscosity of the slug from 1 cP to 2 cP. However, the upside going from 2 cP to 6 cP is not very significant and there is no upside in going from 6 cP to 10 cP so far as lowering the remaining oil saturation in the pattern is concerned. This would support a decision to begin designing the insitu polymer slug viscosity close to 2 cP.</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr34">The cumulative oil chemical ratio improves when polymer viscosity is increased, as shown in Figure 25 below. However, as discussed above, this comes at the cost of an injectivity decrease when the injection fluid is more viscous. Thus, designing for an ASP injection slug viscosity in the range of 2-6 cP is recommended.</p><div id="link-25">
