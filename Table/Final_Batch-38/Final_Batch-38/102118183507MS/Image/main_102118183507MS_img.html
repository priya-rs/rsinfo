<p id="Ancr3">In the literature and from observations made in other fields in the Middle East (Arab, 1990, Al-Ajmi et al, 2001, Carpentier et al, 1998, Carpentier et al, 2006, Jedaan et al, 2007, Heydari 2010), the residual oil is explained by the presence of a paleo oil-water contact. An early water movement and sweep of the accumulated oil, induced by tectonic events after its charging, has induced the trapping of residual oil below the curent Free Water Level. This theory is also supported by the presence of tarmat above and below this Free Water Level along a paleo oil-water contact (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

This surface shows a similar geometry as the top of the reservoir of the studied field "anticline", but with lower amplitude (Fig. 6).

<p id="Ancr12">These high pressures can only be explained by the presence of residual oil below the Free Water Level, which acts as a baffle inducing a partial confinement of the injectors. The baffle effects are explained by the effect of the relative permeabilities (ratio of effective permeability of a particular fluid at a particular saturation to absolute permeability). Each of the 3 zones of the outer ring described previously is characterized by a certain range of water saturation implying a different behavior in terms of relative permeabilities (Fig. 12).</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">Each of the 3 zones of the outer ring described previously is characterized by a certain range of water saturation implying a different behavior in terms of relative permeabilities (Fig. 12). The presence of the residual oil reduces the injected water mobility and leads to an increase of the pressure at the injectors. This phenomenon is more pronounced in the upper part of the reservoir in the studied field as it is the most affected by the presence of residual oil (Fig. 13).</p><div id="link-13">

The simulation model without residual oil was experiencing an early water breakthrough and higher water cut than the history data collected through the field life. In the model with residual oil, this issue is solved: the baffle induced by this oil delays the timing of water breakthrough and reduces the water cut (Fig. 15).</p><div id="link-15">
