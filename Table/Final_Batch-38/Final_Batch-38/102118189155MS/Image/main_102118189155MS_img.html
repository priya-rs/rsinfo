<p id="Ancr1">Production started in the field in 1991 and till date 13 oil wells have been completed in the reservoir and 27 wells have penetrated the structure. The oil-rim in the reservoir is overlain by some 70 ft of gas amounting to over 1 Tcf of gas cap gas. The goal of the next phase of the development is to blow down this gas cap and there is the need to determine the best time to commence the blowdown of the gas cap without joepardising the oil recovery. A properly history-matched model is required for this analysis. A map of the reservoir is shown in Fig.1 below.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">The MCMC technique was deployed using the proxies to get best case history matches and the posterior uncertainty space. Fig 4 shows the spread in the simulation result for cumulative oil using the prior” uncertainty band. The solid line in the plots indicate the measured data. Similar plots were generated for cumulative water and reservoir pressure. The plots envelope the measured data, indicating that there are combinations of parameters within the defined uncertainty band that will reproduce the measured data.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">The “prior” uncertainty band is somewhat biased in this case as indications from the model maturation exercise are considered in building the band. The model maturation exercise which led to better understanding of the dynamic behavior in the reservoir helped in achieving this envelope of the measured data. Fig 5 show the the simulation results after the application of the MCMC technique. This represents results using the posterior uncertainty band i.e. the uncertainty band fully biased by considering the mismatch of the production data. The spread in the results is now closer to the reported data.</p><div id="link-11">

Fig 6 shows the prediction of cumulative oil production from the selected models. There is a convergence of the cases due to the long period of historical data and the number of wells that have penetrated the structure and the reduction in the uncertainty by the history matching exercise.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr17">Fig. 11 is a difference map showing the areas that the adjoint-based optimization technique recommended adjustments in the permeability during the fine-tuning exercise. The recommended changes are localized to a few places in the reservoir. This is an indication that based on the earlier model maturation and experimental design exercises, a reasonably good description of the subsurface has been achieved. If there had been radical changes recommended at this stage, this would have led to a recycle back to model maturation.</p><div id="link-17">

<p id="Ancr18">One further insight was gained from the recommended adjustments, is that it could lead to short term production improvement activities. To achieve a history match, the adjoint technique recommended permeability reductions greater than a factor of 2 in only two wells – Well 20 and Well 08 shown in Fig 12 below. The need to reduce permeability near a well could be due to low permeability areas not properly captured in the geological model or it could also be due to damage.</p><div id="link-18">
