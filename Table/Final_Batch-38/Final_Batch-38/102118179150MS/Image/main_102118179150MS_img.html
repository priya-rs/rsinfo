<p id="Ancr2">An experiment in the Piceance basin of Colorado was the site of a core-through of a hydraulic fracture that had been microseismically monitored a few years earlier (Warpinski et al. 1993). The microseismic data at that time were not particularly accurate because of technology limitations (e.g., single receiver systems), but the core fracture locations were approximately coincident with the microseismic distribu-tion, as shown in Fig. 1. In this case, there were two fracture intervals observed in a deviated-well core across the zone that was fractured, and these were spaced approximately 50 ft apart, so it is difficult to attach any uncertainty of the azimuth relative to the microseismic data.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">In this case, there were two fracture intervals observed in a deviated-well core across the zone that was fractured, and these were spaced approximately 50 ft apart, so it is difficult to attach any uncertainty of the azimuth relative to the microseismic data. In addition, each consisted of multiple strands (8 and 31), and each was in a different interval. Core photos are shown in Fig.2; the core-through wells were deviated approximately 55°, and the layout of the core is approximately as the fracture would be viewed from the side in the subsurface.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">Fig. 5 shows a side view (top panel) of the microseismic event locations relative to the fracture locations in the deviated well. The microseismic data in the top panel are taken from a subset of microseisms that flank the deviated observation well, as indicated in the bottom panel. These microseis-mic locations should be relatively accurate because the observation well, which is located at the same surface location of the intersection well, is less than 300 ft offset. The logging results support the microseismic result, but there is some complexity to the microseismicity that obscures the overall results, possibly because there were multiple injections in this interval.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">This test was different in that it consisted of numerous small volume injections of suspended, ground-up drill cuttings with the objective of testing the theory of a disposal domain, but there were microseismic, surface tiltmeter, and core-hole measurements to corroborate the results. Fig. 6 shows a comparison of the microseismic locations for 17 small-volume injections into the Wilcox sandstone with the multiple cored-fracture locations and the azimuths derived from surface tiltmeter measurements. The overall agreement is relatively good, but because it is difficult to relate specific cored fractures to any particular injection, it is not possible to be entirely definitive.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr8">The overall agreement is relatively good, but because it is difficult to relate specific cored fractures to any particular injection, it is not possible to be entirely definitive. In addition, there are many microseisms that lie outside of the range of the measured fracture azimuth, and these might be the result of the geomechanical changes in the reservoir or the uncertainty in locations.

<p id="Ancr9">The use of surface tiltmeters to determine fracture azimuth is well known (Wright 1998a). A combined microseismic and surface tiltmeter project in the San Juan basin of New Mexico (Estrada et al. 2009) provided a detailed comparison of microseismic monitoring of four fracture stages in each of two wells, with tiltmeter monitoring on those two wells and four others. Fig. 8 shows a comparison of the results for the two sets of data. For these planar fractures in sandstone reservoirs, the azimuths from both the tiltmeters and the microseismic data are consistent, with agreement within a few degrees, which is well within any expected uncertainty bounds for measurements at depth.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr17">A similar data set is shown in Fig. 16 for two identical minifracs that were conducted in the same interval several months later. The minifracs used 400 bbl of a 40-lbm linear gel pumped at 20 bbl/min. Again, the interpreted tiltmeter height agrees well with the microseismic data. It should be noted that there are a few microseismic outliers, but this is not unexpected because there (a) might be uncertainty in the microseismic locations, (b) might be stress effects above and below the actual fracture, or (c) might be isolated places where the fracture actually does have greater height but the tiltmeters only monitor the average height.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr19">Fracture complexity here refers to fracture planes at multiple orientations that are dilating and accepting fluid, as opposed to the planar complexity observed in cored fractures (Figs. 2 and 4). Fig. 18 shows an illustration of various forms of complexity (Warpinski et al. 2009); the lower two cases would be considered complex if the orthogonal fractures dilate. Complexity is a difficult trait to assess because of the potential to be artificially created or obscured by uncertainty in the microseismic measurements. Such complexity was already discussed relative to azimuth (Table 1) measurements in Australia (Johnson et al. 2010) and at Jonah field (Wolhart et al. 2006; Malone et al. 2009).</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr20">As shown in the summary overview of the data from one well in Fig. 19, the microseismic results had a width distribution of approximately 1,000 ft, suggesting the interaction and possible opening of multiple planes. The tiltmeter data (box at lower right and shown schematically by the green rectangle) confirmed that at least as much volume was in the azimuth orthogonal (NW) to the principal fracture plane (NE) as was in that plane, thus validating that orthogonal fractures were opening and not just reflecting some shear process caused by stresses.</p><div id="link-19">

<p id="Ancr21">Fig. 20 shows a comparison of the data, with the microseisms shown as diamonds and the surface tiltmeter results shown as grid- block features. The analysis (Astakhov et al. 2012) breaks the reservoir layer into grid blocks and inverts the surface tilt response to determine the best fit of the fracturing behavior in all of the reservoir blocks. In this example, the magenta-colored grid blocks show horizontal fractures, the cyan grid blocks show vertical fractures (with the azimuth indicated by the darker lines), and the mixed color blocks have both horizontal and vertical components.</p><div id="link-20">
