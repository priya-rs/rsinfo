<anchoringText id="Ancr5">Two-dimensional (2D) micromodels gain insight into pore-level displacement mechanisms that control multiphase fluid flow at core-scale (Gauteplass et al. 2015; Fredriksen et al. 2016). Etched silicon-wafer micromodels connected to a microfluidic flow rig with a high-resolution camera microscope enabled direct pore-scale visualization of fluid saturations, fluid flow interactions and displacement processes during CO2-foam flow. The micromodels inherit the essential characteristics of a porous media (Table 2), and a detailed description of the manufacturing process can be found elsewhere (Hornbrook et al. 1991; Buchgraber et al. 2012). Fluid distribution ports are located in each corner and channels (termed “fractures”) connects the ports horizontally opposite each other (see Figure 1).</anchoringText>

The reservoir core plug was drilled horizontally (parallel to bedding) from a borehole core from an offset producer in the pilot well pattern (see Figure 2). The core plug was cleaned for 72 hours in a Dean Stark apparatus with a 1:1 solution (by volume) of toluene and methanol, extracting any residual fluids.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">A baseline flow test was performed in micromodel to evaluate the two-phase system without surfactant present. Visual observations showed few gas bubbles per unit area and the gas phase spanning over several pores without being separated by liquid films (see Figure 4). This is referred to as a continuous-gas foam (Schramm 1994) and is characterized by high multi-phase fluid flow potential and low reduction in CO2 mobility. There was no lamella generation observed and the water phase was continuous throughout the porous media. CO2 flow occured primarily in medium to large pores, whereas the smaller pores remained water saturated during co-injection. The few CO2 bubbles observed were situated in pores surrounded by narrow pore throats, suggesting bubble generation by snap-off.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr9">To evaluate in-situ foam generation by adding the surfactant (concentration: 1 wt%) to the aqueous phase, a co-injection at the same conditions as the baseline was performed (Figure 5). A strong CO2-foam was generated, with high bubble concentration where most pores were filled with multiple bubbles. This is an important observation as it greatly increases the amount of lamellae per unit area and decrease CO2 mobility. In contrast to baseline, the CO2 phase did not span several pores and flow diversion occurred in correspondence with local foam generation and coalescence, governing the local fluid flow potential and therefor the volumetric flowrate.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr10">To determine the static foam strength (thermodynamic stability) at elevated pressure, foam coalescence was measured during no-flow, static conditions for 72 hours. The normalized bubble concentration (ratio of number of bubbles at each time step to initial number of bubbles) within a pre field of view enabled quantification of foam strength as a function of time (see Figure 6). The coalescence rate decreased for the first 30 hours before asymptotically approaching a constant normalized bubble concentration of 0.37 (±0.06), after 70 hours.</anchoringText>

The CO2 storage potential for each gas fraction was calculated from the ratio of volume element of CO2 stored to volume element of oil produced (VEE, Table 4). The VEE values show that both gas fractions stored more CO2 (in terms of VEE) than produced oil (VEE &#x003E; 1), and that CO2 storage effect was 50% higher for fg=0.70 relative to fg=0.80. Hence, as incremental oil recovery was equal for the two cases, the stronger foam at fg=0.70 mobilized more water from the pore space resulting in higher CO2 storage potential (see Figure 12).</anchoringText>
