<p id="Ancr10">To date, all of the Raageshwari gas well completions were 3 ½" monobore vertical wells with 9.2 ppf P110 tubing to surface. This design was dictated by the worst tubing load observable during the well life cycle which would occur during the fracturing operation in a screenout to surface incident (Jha, 2010). All other loads (frac diagnostics, routine frac pumping, and well production) were found to apply considerably lower loads on the completion. Figure 4 shows the details of the current well design.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr11">The comparison of tubing friction in Figure 5 shows that if we assume that the limitations for total tubing friction stay the same which allowed for 25 bpm in the 3 ½ inch completion, injection rates between 35 and 40 bpm can be achieved by either partially or completely replacing the 3 ½ inch pipe with 4 ½ inch pipe. Another constraint in the well design is the required gas velocities for liquid unloading (especially in the deeper zones).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">The CRs calculated by the model were validated using PLT data. The cumulative rate from the frac stages above which no static water column was observed in the PLT was taken to be the CR. The CRs measured in such a way from the PLTs matched well with the theoretical CRs (see Table 1). Since the wells in RDG have a 3-1/2" monobore completion the critical rates for 4-1/2" could not be verified. By combining the CR results with the requirements for fracturing, the optimum design for future wells was found to be a 3 ½ inch liner with 4 ½ inch tubing (see schematic in Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr15">The workflow shown in Figure 9 was generated to provide a framework for improving fracturing results. The first step was to calibrate the log stress in pays using closure pressured inferred from extended DFIT's from the pay sections. Once the stresses were confirmed, the variation between the pays was statistically evaluated. The observed average stress variation between the pays was less than 400 psi. This was the basis for initial limited entry perforation design.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">After perforating per the design, a pre-frac SRT was conducted. (See an example SRT from well Y in Figure 10). The objective of the SRT was to determine the perforation pressure drop and ensure that it was at or above the minimum 600 psi. The perforation pressure drop was evaluated using a step down (SD) test at the end of the SRT. The pressure drops at different rates were compared with estimated values to flag any unusual cases. After approximately 30 SD tests were analyzed, it was clear that the observed perforation friction was much higher than the predicted pressure. This led to an estimate of between 50 and 75% perforation efficiency (% of perforations actually taking fluid).</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr19">This was later increased to 30 after diagnostic testing, temperature surveys and post frac pressure matching confirmed good diversion. Therefore, the workflow consisted of taking the available number of perforations and distributing them over 2 to 6 separate zones. In the first pass, the perforations were equally distributed. Subsequently, the perforations were redistributed to obtain the desired fracture dimensions for each zone. In some cases, separate individual fractures were generated while in other cases the fractures coalesced. Figure 13 shows two examples of the two simulation extremes.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr20">The fracturing fluid used in the treatments was a 35 (lb/1000) borate crosslinked guar. In the last campaign, the breaker was designed to break the fluid after the fracture closure to minimize proppant settling. Since the time to fracture closure could be as long as 200 min, the fluid had to remain stable for at least this long and break afterwards. In order to achieve this, encapsulated breaker was incorporated into the system. Figure 14 shows an example of a typical RDG stability test showing working time (viscosity greater than 100 cP at 100 sec-1) more than 200 min.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr22">To use this water, a specially tailored frac fluid had to be developed. More than 60 lab tests were conducted before obtaining an acceptable fluid formulation. Unfortunately, the new formulation had much faster crosslink times which resulted in higher tubing friction and lower overall injection rates. An in-well test with bottom hole gauges was eventually used to adequately characterize fluid friction for design and evaluation purposes. These tests showed that the observed friction pressure was 20%higher than expected (see Figure 16).</p><div id="link-16">

This is especially true for treatments pumped down 3 ½ inch tubing where the tubing friction can be as high as 3000 psi and a 20% error in tubing friction would completely mask the perforation friction.

<p id="Ancr29">This was followed by perforation of the fourth cluster and a second SRT. Figure 22 shows the plot of total entry friction vs rate for each injection. It shows that the entry friction at 30 bpm dropped about 900 psi. Since the both SRTs were run at similar rates with linear gel, the only difference would be the additional perforation area. Analysis of this combined test indicated that 50 to 60% of the perforations were taking fluid. A temperature survey (see Figure 23) after the final SRT confirmed that all four clusters were taking fluid.</p><div id="link-23">

<p id="Ancr30">Evaluation such as these in more than 35 tests consistently showed higher entry friction. This provided the basis for increasing the maximum number of perforations from 24 to 30. Eventually as many as 6 clusters per stage were successfully placed. Entry into all the clusters was confirmed with temperature surveys performed after SRTs and frac jobs like the post SRT survey done in well T (see Figure 24).</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr40">Two key history matching points are the fracture height and the ISIP. Since most of the wells had significant proppant fill after the frac, it was impossible to determine the bottom of the lowest fracture from the temperature logs. However, in many cases it was possible to locate the top of the upper most frac. Figure 34 shows a crossplot of measured vs actual fracture top (normalized to a zero depth). The closer the points are to the diagonal line, the better the match. The prediction of the top of the fracture was very successful.</p><div id="link-34">
