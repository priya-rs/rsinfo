<p id="Ancr4">Kuwait’s onshore Burgan field is the world’s second largest oil field, situated in the South East as shown in Figure 1. This prolific reservoir, discovered in 1938, produces approximately one-half of Kuwait’s total oil production. The operator assigns high priority and focus on the continued development of the Burgan field to increase production rates.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The Drilling Application Review Team (DART) shown in Figure 2 above, set the drilling optimization of the Burgan field’s 12 ¼ in. hole section as their challenge, based on the operator’s expressed requirements. Drilling NPT minimization and CPF reduction were sought through improvements in ROP, drilling dynamics, and resulting drilling efficiency.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">The earlier 25mm cutters had shown tremendous performance potential in PDC bits in the early 1990’s, but were considered to be too brittle or fracture prone for consistently long runs, particularly through transition zones. The lack of overall durability was due to the diamond table technologies, the relatively small cutter chamfers specified (typically 0.010 in. or less), and the state of PDC bit design principles at that time. Figure 5 below shows an example of a PDC bit with 25mm cutters from the early 1990’s.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr9">Larger chamfers were also specified for the 25mm cutters, to enhance overall cutter durability and longevity. All the body cutters also incorporate polished cutter faces which reduce surface friction as the cuttings pass across the cutter faces, thereby improving cutting efficiency and preventing balling tendencies in the sticky shale formations. The new 25mm cutters are 53% stronger than conventional 19mm cutters. Figure 6 below displays the full range of cutter diameters currently in use by the industry, and illustrates just how large a 25mm cutter is in comparison to 19mm (and smaller) cutters.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">A new 6-bladed PDC bit design was created with 25mm cutters, replacing the 19mm cutters used on essentially all other 12 ¼ in. PDC bit designs used to date in the Burgan field (see Figure 7 below). The new 25mm bit design was tailored to strike a balance between drilling aggressiveness and vibration control. The large cutter’s unique depth-of-cut potential and increased cutter exposure were combined with reduced bit imbalance and degree of rubbing via numerous computerized simulations using proprietary CAD software with integrated kinematics and dynamics analysis modules.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">A dedicated field specialist was at the rigsite for each of the first three field test runs of the new 25mm bit design to monitor and recommend adjustments to the drilling parameters, observe the overall bit drilling responses, and inspect the dull conditions after the bits were pulled from the well. The enhanced DOC design achieved breakthrough performance, increasing ROP from the field benchmark average 76 ft/hr to 230, 285, and 290 ft/hr in these first three runs, respectively, as shown in Figure 8 below. This represents a 300% to 380% increase in ROP vs. the benchmark ROP, which resulted in a 30%+ reduction in CPF vs. the benchmark CPF.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">The durability displayed by the enhanced DOC bit design on the first three wells was also excellent. The same matrix body bit was used to drill the first two wells, with no repairs required to the first bit frame between the first and second runs. A steel body version of this bit was used to drill the third well, with an excellent dull condition on this bit as well (see Figure 9 below).</p><div id="link-9">
