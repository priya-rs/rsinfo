<p id="Ancr1">The porous zones consist of clean limestone and the texture is mainly Packstone (Grainstone) with some Wackestone and Boundstone. Each zone (referred as Reservoir 1, 2 &amp; 3 in this paper) has different permeability with the middle zone (reservoir 2) having comparatively higher permeability, as shown in Figure 1 (a, b, c). The thick impermeable dense zone in between two porous zones provides sealing between two reservoirs.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">For water injection well ICD modeling, the main data input requirements are reservoir pressure profile along the proposed drain, permeability profile, surface injection pressure and target injection rates. In some cases, where permeability data was not available and/or not matching with the actual well performance of the nearby injectors, nearby wells' injectivity data was used in the model to achieve realistic injection profiles in open hole condition to simulate. By using this technique, the model was built as an open hole and matched with nearby wells' performance, this performance was classified as the base case for building ICD model. As an example the open hole model results are shown in Figure-9.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">In subject field, the caliper log runs were not performed initially for first five wells as there was no historical data available regarding washouts and over gauge hole problem in these reservoir sections. Hence 4-1/2" liners with ICDs were run across Reservoir 2 directly after drilling 6" hole in all wells. This operation sequence saved rig time and cost of running caliper log. After five successful ICD completion deployments, a packer leak was observed in the sixth well through PLT logging which resulted in 65% of water injection in Reservoir 2 compared to the designed injection split of 45% as shown in Figure 12.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr13">Due to open system (ICD across Reservoir 2 &amp; open hole across Reservoir 3 as shown in Figure-6), another problem was encountered with running on/off ICDs where open hole hydraulic (mechanical) packer requires an inner string to set. Running inner string requires additional care to avoid accidental closing of ICDs. This particular problem was observed in one well while POOH with inner string after setting packers that accidently closed the sleeves and hence resulted in no water injection in Reservoir 2 for first 6 months. This was later confirmed by running PLT log (Figure-13 a). Later in this well, coil tubing with ICD shifting tool was run to open on/off ICDs and resumed water injection in Reservoir 2 (Figure-13 b).</p><div id="link-13">
