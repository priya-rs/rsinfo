<p id="Ancr8">To analyze the overall production and injection trends of the section, bubble plots were created, as shown in Fig. 3. Cumulative oil produced is represented by green, cumulative water produced by dark blue and cumulative water injected by light blue. No gas production data was available. The size of the bubble is relative to one another and to the cumulative volumes produced. Well 191/01-36 is the biggest water producer with very similar oil production volumes. This well was later converted to an injector. Local variance in water production can happen due to a variety of reasons, and is addressed in the modeling work discussion.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr11">Individual well production was analyzed in a multi-well plot as shown in Fig. 6. The first few weeks of higher liquid and water production was partially attributed to fracture fluid being flowed back. The primary drive for this reservoir is solution gas; therefore, over time, both oil and water production declined. It is critical to note that water rates are decreasing with time. Also, as stated earlier, a degree of water influx was needed to explain higher reservoir pressure and increasing watercuts. The silt zones are less permeable than the Three Forks and therefore provide relatively weak water support compared to a classic strong water drive system.</p><div id="link-6">

In the last two years, all injectors have seen a gradual decrease and flattening in their water injection rates as initial fill up has occurred and reservoir pressure has increased to an established maximum allowable injection pressure.

The slope of the line representes the waterflood's efficiency. This plot can thus be used to compare the relative efficiency of waterfloods in analogous pools. Fig. 10 shows the resulting RF versus HCPVI graph of Section 36 in comparison to a few analogue projects. Section 36 is an immature flood as compared to the Tundra waterfloods, but it does however display a similar trending slope or waterflood efficiency as the Tundra units.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr17">In Fig. 12 all of the waterfloods see a trend that curves to the left into negative net water injected/MPV. This trend represents the time period before injection begins where the project is under primary production and therefore the net water injected term becomes negative. More water has been produced from the formation under primary recovery relative to the movable pore space if the plot trends farther left. As seen from Fig. 12, Fertile Section 36 had more primary water production than the analogue units due to production contributions from the higher water saturations in the Bakken silts that are not present in the analogue units.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr19">To initialize the model with the appropriate amount of mobile water, capillary pressure curves were used. By introducing a capillary pressure curve, the initial water saturation of each formation was initialized. However, there is no capillary pressure lab test data available for either formation. This meant that assumptions had to be made on the curvature of the capillary pressure trend as well as the absolute values of the capillary pressure forces as seen in Fig. 14. The curves are history matched to an average water saturation of 50% in the Bakken silt and 40% in the Three Forks. A free water level of 595 m or 30 m below the grid was assumed for this simulation.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr20">A water layer was introduced into the Bakken silt to account for the increased water production after hydraulic fracturing. As mentioned before, well 191/04-36 had production from an openhole completion (pre-fracture) between December 2005 and June 2008. Fig. 15 shows that oil was more mobile than water during this period. After post-hydraulic fracture, water volumes were more movable and more easily produced, indicating the hydraulic fractures must have acessed water that was not accessible before the fracture process. Observations from core suggest that tighter facies within the complex stratified Bakken silts could account for this water. The water layer was initialized with a very strong capillary pressure curve</p><div id="link-15">
