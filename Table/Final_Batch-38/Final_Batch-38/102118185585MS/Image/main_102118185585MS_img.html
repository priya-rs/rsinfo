<p id="Ancr9">Figure 3 shows fields where the WF started, beginning with Cañadón León and Anticlinal Grande and other fields of Cerro Dragón along with Pico Truncado (El destino). In the 1980s, several WF processes started in Chubut and Santa Cruz provinces, and in the 1990s the projects of the rest of the major concessions began. Between 1993 and 1999, WF processes were intensively developed in the largest companies. Even so the intensity of these developments has been very heterogeneous and clearly partial as can be seen in further sections. Qualitatively it can be said that the secondary or WF development it is between advanced and partially advanced depending on its location.</p><div id="link-3">

As mentioned before, there are 11,500 shut in wells, suggesting that there is room for improvement, partly through their usage previous mechanical status check) as producers and/or water injectors. In fact, many of them are supposedly being considered as part of the future development plans in the Reserves and Resources Plans informed.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr12">The Figure 6 shows only active injector wells, it is possible to have a visual appreciation of the degree of the waterflooding development and to understand its intensity, when comparing Figure 5 with Figure 6. The more intensely blue (a few ones) zones are those that have more injectors and more confinement of producers with well spacings from 300 m to some cases of 170 m. The latter have generally been designed as they have vertically significant reservoir stacking.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr13">In the absence of the above mentioned information (OOIP and Optimal RF on a reservoir basis) we tried to get closer to knowing the maturity of the fields by including an analysis of the exploitation type that each field has (Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary). Figure 7 shows an approach to the field's maturity degree characterizing each one by its exploitation type and Depletion Factor vs WOR, where different behaviors are observed.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr14">The more than 15 years experience of multidisciplinary teams (typically conformed by both VYP Consultores SA staff and the Client's professionals) using a consistent and detailed methodology and having an important areal coverage of the basin, allows us to make many observations and estimate intrinsic parameters needed to screen and evaluate incremental projects. Figure 8 shows the block studies carried out which represent 13% of the total wells in the basin and 25% of the current water injection volume.</p><div id="link-8">
