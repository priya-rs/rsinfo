<anchoringText id="Ancr3">The Kerisi field was discovered in 1990 by the Kerisi–1A well and then appraised by 3 further wells. The field covers an area of approximately 18 km2 in Eastern Hub – Block B Offshore PSC Area, South Natuna Sea, Indonesia. It located in Indonesian offshore waters approximately 200 miles NE of Singapore (Fig.1) with approximate water depth of 300 feet.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr4">Kerisi Field is inverted NE – SW four-way dip structures limited by a major reverse fault to the South. It is cut by a series of smaller faults trending SE – NW and NE – SW. A major fault trending SE – NW with displacement up to 500 ft separating the Western and Eastern Kerisi field. Henning et. al15 explained that this major fault is sealing the eastern and western part of the block. Production data later confirmed that there is no interference from wells on each block, thus no transmissibility is present. Hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in Kerisi field are Upper Gabus (UG), Gabus Zone 3 (Z3), and Lower Gabus (LG) as shown by Figure 2.</anchoringText>

These liquids are pumped to Belanak FPSO, as a sales point, 23 km from KCPP through 16 inch pipeline.

<anchoringText id="Ancr11">Figure 9 shows a production performance of UGMW with time. Gas injection process can be best evaluated by plotting cumulative voidage against time, as shown at the top of the plot. Cumulative Voidage is the the volume of produced fluid (oil, gas, condensate, and water) minus the volume of gas injected at reservoir condition. When production is higher than injection the slope will be big, indicating high voidage is occurring in the reservoir.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr12">The graphical method plot (Fig. 10) shows a typical classic material balance straight line to estimate oil initially in place (OOIP). The OOIP was estimated within 9% of static models. The reservoir drive plot clearly shows that gas expansion/injection and pore volume expansion are the key production drivers with negligible effects the water influx. At initial condition pore volume expansion is the main force to production, but with time as the fluid is more produced gas injection start to dominate the drive mechanism. Material balance was also used to give an estimate of the current GOC, which is at 3,886 ft or 83 ft below the initial depth.</anchoringText>

End point scaling was therefore applied together with the relative permeability model from the Kerisi– 4 core (Figure 11). With high permeability and relatively thin reservoir supported by no sustained water production and no noticeable free water saturation, the capillary pressures were considered to be negligible. Key uncertainties in the updated model were identified as sand extension from seismic, sand-shale ratio and shale elongation from newer channel erosion.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr23">Figure 20 show that non-recycling has a consistently higher NPV compared to the "recycling case". Higher injection rates result in marginally higher NPVs. The NPV is also higher with the additional of the KRS-12 in the "no–recycling" case, showing that there is a benefit in the drilling of this well. Further analysis is required to calculate the incremental benefit of drilling KRS-12 by subtracting these two curves. Figure 21 shows that NPV is eroded with injection rates higher than 50 MMSCFD.</anchoringText>

<caption>NPV Benefit of Drilling KRS-12 The picture above is the difference between the project NPV of drilling and no drilling of KRS-12 in no-recycle case. It shows that the NPV will be eroded when the injection is bigger than 50 MMSCFD, which means that the most beneficial injection volume thru KRS-5, if KRS-12 is drilled, is 50 MMSCFD.</caption>
