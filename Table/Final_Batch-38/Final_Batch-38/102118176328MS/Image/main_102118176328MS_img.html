<p id="Ancr3">The Kerisi field was discovered in 1990 by the Kerisi–1A well and then appraised by 3 further wells. The field covers an area of approximately 18 km2 in Eastern Hub – Block B Offshore PSC Area, South Natuna Sea, Indonesia. It located in Indonesian offshore waters approximately 200 miles NE of Singapore (Fig.1) with approximate water depth of 300 feet.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">Kerisi Field is inverted NE – SW four-way dip structures limited by a major reverse fault to the South. It is cut by a series of smaller faults trending SE – NW and NE – SW. A major fault trending SE – NW with displacement up to 500 ft separating the Western and Eastern Kerisi field. Henning et. al15 explained that this major fault is sealing the eastern and western part of the block. Production data later confirmed that there is no interference from wells on each block, thus no transmissibility is present. Hydrocarbon bearing reservoirs in Kerisi field are Upper Gabus (UG), Gabus Zone 3 (Z3), and Lower Gabus (LG) as shown by Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

Partially stabilized and dewatered oil received from Kerisi CPP will be flowed through a heater to the HP Separator for further processing to meet export Reid Vapor Pressure (RVP) and Basic Sediment and Water (BS&amp;W) specifications. These liquids are pumped to Belanak FPSO, as a sales point, 23 km from KCPP through 16 inch pipeline. Part of the remaining lean gas is diverted for fuel, before compression, for plant and the compressors itself.

<p id="Ancr11">Figure 9 shows a production performance of UGMW with time. Gas injection process can be best evaluated by plotting cumulative voidage against time, as shown at the top of the plot. Cumulative Voidage is the the volume of produced fluid (oil, gas, condensate, and water) minus the volume of gas injected at reservoir condition. When production is higher than injection the slope will be big, indicating high voidage is occurring in the reservoir.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">The graphical method plot (Fig. 10) shows a typical classic material balance straight line to estimate oil initially in place (OOIP). The OOIP was estimated within 9% of static models. The reservoir drive plot clearly shows that gas expansion/injection and pore volume expansion are the key production drivers with negligible effects the water influx. At initial condition pore volume expansion is the main force to production, but with time as the fluid is more produced gas injection start to dominate the drive mechanism. Material balance was also used to give an estimate of the current GOC, which is at 3,886 ft or 83 ft below the initial depth.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">A water saturation distribution model generated from petrophysics instead of using single water saturation for the whole grid. End point scaling was therefore applied together with the relative permeability model from the Kerisi– 4 core (Figure 11). With high permeability and relatively thin reservoir supported by no sustained water production and no noticeable free water saturation, the capillary pressures were considered to be negligible. Key uncertainties in the updated model were identified as sand extension from seismic, sand-shale ratio and shale elongation from newer channel erosion.</p><div id="link-11">
