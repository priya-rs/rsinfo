<p id="Ancr1">A polymer flood in Bhagyam would limit polymer injection to the oil leg. This would promote sweep within a closer well spacing and avoid the loss of polymer to the aquifer. This is a change from the current process which uses peripheral injection. Two producers, B-113 and B-118, were selected as polymer injectivity test candidates as they were positioned in the central part of field forming a 5 spot pattern with the surrounding wells representative of the field water cut (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-1">

A provision was made to inject at temperatures above the wax appearance temperature in order to mitigate the risk of near wellbore wax drop-out.

<p id="Ancr25">The well injectivity would be significantly impacted by the non-newtonian characteristics of the polymer solution in porous media. In order to decide the optimum level of grid refinement to capture this effect, simulation runs were made with different levels of grid refinement around the well B–118 (Fig. 25). In general, well head injection pressure was found to decrease with increase in level of refinement. The calculated fluid velocity in the grid cells increased with increase in level of refinement and hence level of shear thinning of polymer increased. It was observed that 1/9th refinement of grid size and 1/11th refinement of grid size produced similar results, hence, 1/9th grid size was taken as the optimum level of grid refinement for this case.</p><div id="link-25">
