<p id="Ancr5">The Weyburn-Midale field is located in southeast Saskatchewan, Canada (Fig. 1). It was discovered in 1953 and is one of the largest medium-sour oil reservoirs in Canada. Waterflooding began in 1964, followed by horizontal drilling in the 1990s (Protti, 2005). Although, these measures helped production, an enhanced oil recovery (EOR) process was implemented using CO2 to revert long-term production decline and to demonstrate the large-scale geologic storage of CO2 (Ansarizadeh et al. 2015).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Vertical producers are normally casedhole whereas the horizontals are openhole, mainly completed for commingled production, controlled by the wellhead valve. A candidate well that incorporated different horizons and reflected the complex reservoir conditions was selected. The vertical candidate chosen serves the purpose since it penetrates the main horizons of the Marly formation (M1, M2 and M3), as shown in Fig. 2, and is in communication with the offset WAG injector.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr28">The comparison shows how the well ratios improved as the oil cut increased from 0.4% to 1.3%, water cut decreased from 99.6% to 98.7% (Fig. 24), and GOR decreased from 32,000 scf/bbl to 10,500 scf/bbl (Fig. 25). This improvement allowed increasing oil rate from 5 BOPD to 45 BOPD, which translates into an improvement of 810% on oil rate.</p><div id="link-24">
