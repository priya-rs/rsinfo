<p id="Ancr8">To reduce the uncertainty in model predictions and more reliably optimize Utica development, a comprehensive field experiment was conducted to compare P&amp;P and CEP completions, determine fracture geometry as a function of treatment size and completion strategy, and calibrate hydraulic fracture and reservoir simulation models on a five-well pad in the rich gas (~20 bbl/MMCF) region of the Utica (Fig. 1). The five-well pad consisted of 7000 ft laterals drilled in the Point Pleasant formation with all wells 100%in the target interval.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr9">The Utica Shale consists of several stratigraphic units of Middle Ordovician age in the Appalachian Basin and is composed of calcareous, organic-rich shale (Melick et al. 2016). The primary reservoir target is the Point Pleasant formation, which is directly below the Utica formation and bounded below by the Trenton Lime. Fig. 2 shows a typical log section and geological model for the Utica Shale and bounding rock. The geo-model for this work included rock mechanical properties, pore pressures, and stress data required for hydraulic fracture modeling.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr10">Natural fracture orientations were based on regional image logs and core data, indicating a dominant orientation of 310°, with secondary orientations of 265°and 220°. The spacing and length of the natural fractures were used as a calibrating parameter for hydraulic fracture modeling to match microseismic data. Fig. 3 shows the DFN used for hydraulic fracture modeling, including the spacing and length of each natural fracture set. The geo-model and DFN were used for all subsequent hydraulic fracture modeling and reservoir simulation history matching</p><div id="link-3">

The variation in fracture treatment designs is highlighted for the 1H and 5H wells for reference. The microseismic results for the 1H well clearly show that increasing treatment volume results in longer hydraulic fractures.

<p id="Ancr13">Fig. 6 shows a depth view of the microseismic events in the heel-most stages of the 1H, 2H, and 5H wells (heel stages were not monitored in the 4H). The vast majority of the microseismic events are located in the Utica-Point Pleasant interval denoted in green in Fig. 6. There is a lower density of events immediately above and below the target interval, suggesting limited fracture growth in the Reedsville C and Trenton. There are spurious shallow events that are likely induced due to deformation caused by the hydraulic fracture in the Utica-Point Pleasant.</p><div id="link-6">

The toe of the 1H lateral is shown for reference. The majority of the microseismic data were acquired with the geophone array in the lateral of the 3H well.

<p id="Ancr15">Fig. 8 shows the injection rates and BHP data for one of the nearby DFITs used for this work, showing a very high pressure drop in the first 5 minutes after pump shutdown. This is typical of Utica DFITs and large propped fracture treatments, precluding simple calculations of net pressure based on ISIP data. This very high pressure drop is likely due to severe near wellbore fracture complexity and appears to mostly dissipate within 5 minutes after pump shutdown. Therefore, net pressures are calculated using the pressure 5 minutes after pump shutdown (denoted as the 5-minute ISIP).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr16">The G-function graph in Fig. 9 indicates a fracture closure pressure of 7620 psi (0.87 psi/ft). Closure was picked using the classical DFIT analysis technique presented by Barree et al. (2007, 2014). The 5-minute ISIP for this DFIT was 8480 psi, resulting in a net pressure of 860 psi. The Compliance Method for picking fracture closure was introduced by McClure et al. [2016] and suggests that fracture closure occurs at much lower pressures corresponding to the deviation from the first straight line region on the GdP/dG curve.</p><div id="link-9">

All three tracers were detected in each perforation cluster, confirming that all perforation clusters broke down and indicating continuous proppant entry into all four perforation clusters throughout the treatment.

<p id="Ancr29">Fig. 22 presents a small portion of the reservoir simulation grid showing the hydraulic fracture cells, and it illustrates the complexity of the grid and the location of the un-propped fractures, 100-mesh sand, and 30/50-mesh sand. The geometry of the fractures and location of proppant in the simulation grid match the results from the calibrated complex fracture model. The reservoir simulation grids included the 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, and B4H wells and consisted of one layer representing the Point Pleasant interval, 5-ft cell width for the hydraulic fractures, and unstructured grids to accommodate the complex fracture geometries.</p><div id="link-22">

In addition to relative permeability effects, a further decrease in fracture conductivity at the dew-point was approximated using the compaction curves. This creates the "kink" in the fracture conductivity curve around 2500 psi.</p><div id="link-23">

Original reservoir pressure is shown in red, with the majority of depletion predicted in the vicinity of the B4H (shown in blue and purple). The simulation predicts approximately 500-1000 psi depletion in the natural fractures around the 5H lateral and 300-500 psi depletion in the natural fractures around the 4H lateral, with higher pressures in the matrix.</p><div id="link-24">

<p id="Ancr35">An alternate history match was performed to evaluate the impact of limiting the B4H drainage to an area proximal to the hydraulic fractures. Fig. 28 shows the simulated pressure for the B4H, assuming no production from natural fractures. It illustrates the classical depletion pattern for unconventional reservoirs with drainage very proximal to the hydraulic fractures. The contribution of the natural fractures to the early-time B4H production is minor.</p><div id="link-28">

<p id="Ancr36">To evaluate the impact of fracture complexity on the production modeling and subsequent completion and well spacing optimizations, a production history match was performed using the geometries from the calibrated planar hydraulic fracture model. Fig. 29 presents a portion of the reservoir simulation grid for the planar fracture case, showing the location of 30/50-mesh sand, 100-mesh sand, and un-propped portions of the hydraulic fractures. The grid is much simpler than the complex fracture grid (reference Fig. 22), but overlap of the hydraulic fractures due to stress shadow effects is still predicted by the fracture modeling.</p><div id="link-29">

The gas recovery is normalized based on the recovery of the case with 1100 ft well spacing, 55 ft cluster spacing, and small treatments. Five year gas recovery is used for the comparisons because early-time production dominates economic performance. The tightest well spacing studied was 825 ft, which equates to five wells per drilling unit, and shows the highest gas recovery. The largest well spacing of 1467 ft corresponds to three wells per drilling unit and shows the lowest gas recovery.</p><div id="link-31">

<p id="Ancr39">A detailed economic study was performed using the production forecasts for the 36 optimization cases. Fig. 32 shows an example economic comparison of the optimization cases, illustrating that the maximum net present value (NPV) can vary significantly depending on the fracture geometry assumption. The maximum NPV is predicted for the case with planar hydraulic fractures, 1100-ft well spacing, large treatments, and 30-ft cluster spacing. However, there are a number of cases with similar NPV. Given that complex hydraulic fractures may be more probable than planar fractures, from the NPV projections in Fig. 32, it appears that the 825-ft well spacing, 30-ft cluster spacing, and small treatments is the optimum development strategy.</p><div id="link-32">
