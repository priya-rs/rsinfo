<p id="Ancr3">The operator has been actively drilling appraisal and development wells in the Central and Western Planning Areas of DW GOM (Fig. 1). A typical well is drilled to the measured depth (MD) of 25,000 to 28,000 ft. under at least 4,000 ft. of water. In most wells, the surface section includes jetting a 36-in. conductor, followed by drilling a 26-in. hole and then running 22-in. casing. The 26-in. section is drilled without a riser, and returns are diverted to the seabed. This interval is vertical and the drive system used for drilling the section is a positive displacement motor (PDM) or a rotary steerable system (RSS).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The average ROP achieved with RC bits and a PDM motor were 110.0 and 169.3 ft./hr., where bits drilled 2,799 and 3,344 ft. of clastic formation respectively (Fig. 2). However, the PDC bits that drilled the clastic sediment and salt could only achieve an average ROP of 55.6 and 68.0 ft./hr. and drilled approximately 1,800 ft. interval in each run. In an exploratory drilling program, a PDC bit achieved ROP of 180 ft./hr. in the clastic sediments but is not included in the current study as the well was exploratory.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">While drilling the offset wells with a PDC bit and a RSS, high torsional and lateral vibrations were observed. These increased to high and unsustainable levels after salt entry (Fig. 3). The geo-mechanical nature of the salt required high WOB for higher ROP. However, due to the increased vibration levels, a high WOB could not be applied. It is known that fixed cutter PDC bits generate higher torque due to its shearing action and, if not managed, they could generate torsional vibration and stick-slip, which could cause a downhole tool failure (Jaggi 2007, Roy Chowdhury 2017) and potential non-productive time (NPT).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Given the challenges faced while drilling the offset wells, it was envisioned that hybrid technology was a potential solution that could address the challenges and drill at higher ROP. The hybrid technology combines RC and PDC cutting elements in a single frame (Fig. 4), thus drilling with stability nearer to RC bits and the aggressiveness of a fixed cutter bit (Pessier 2010). The periphery of the hole that is difficult to drill uses dual-cutting elements of TC and PDC bits.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The first 26-in. section drilled with the hybrid bit (Target-1) completed the 3,391 ft. section in 13.3 onbottom drilling hours with a resultant ROP of 255 ft./hr. When compared to the best offset ROP, it was a 50.6% improvement in these similar clastic sediments (Fig. 5). As the learning progressed and parameters were optimized, two subsequent 3,389 ft. hole sections in similar clastic sediments were drilled at 307.5 and 379.1 ft./hr. This activity was 81.6% and 123.9% faster than the best offset ROP in clastic sediments. These three hybrid runs were consecutive records for on-bottom ROP for a 26-in. section.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">The ROP are predominantly used as an indicator of the bit performance. However, ROP could vary based on changes in parameters and other drilling environment variables. Comparison of mechanical specific energy (MSE) of one bit run against other provides a good tool for drilling efficiency (Dupriest 2005, Pessier 2012) review and comparison. (Fig. 6) depicts the MSE of different offset and target bit runs versus ROP while drilling in clastic sediments. The more-efficient area of the graph is when the values are located higher and to the left.</p><div id="link-6">
