<p id="Ancr1">Using the finite-difference method of one of the most common computational simulators (Eclipse Schlumberger), a case of entering a low-permeable reservoir (Kper&lt;1 mD) by a horizontal well, which penetrated two superconductive vertical intervals (Kper&gt;&gt;100 mD) spreading deep down the stratum to the distance significantly exceeding the borehole diameter (Wf&lt;Rwell, Xf&gt;&gt;Rwell) was analyzed on a fine screen. Actually, the case of penetration of two subvertical conductive macrofractures is simulated (figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr24">This method in combination with highly precise temperature logging enables detailing inflow intervals with the best vertical resolution (to dozens of centimeters) and determination of the inflow nature. This method is based on noise sensing in an operating well, and the frequency-amplitude characteristic of noise could indicate the environment of fluid filtration. Applying various mathematical filters to the noise spectrum in the well, the flow intervals can be directly divided by the reservoir matrix (0.3-1 kHz) and by fractures (15-30 kHz) (Figures 24-25).</p><div id="link-24">
