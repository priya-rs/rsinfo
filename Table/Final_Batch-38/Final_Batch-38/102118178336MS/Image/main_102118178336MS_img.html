Shore face relics were preserved in few wells. From available sidewall sample descriptions and wireline log data, the reservoir is made up of fine to coarse grained sands, and it exhibits retrograding and aggrading stacking patterns. The Reservoir A package is further subdivided into three flow units comprising two sand units separated by an extensive shale unit (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">
