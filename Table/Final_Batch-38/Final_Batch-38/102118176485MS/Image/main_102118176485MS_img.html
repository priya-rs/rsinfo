<p id="Ancr1">The Maari oil field was the first OMV operated offshore field development, with first oil in February 2009. A number of technical challenges needed to be overcome in order to make the project viable about 25 years after the initial discovery was made. This included the offshore environment, reservoir drive mechanism and the waxy type of crude. During the drilling and completion phase of the Maari development, various techniques were employed in order to keep the project economically viable. These included drilling with 24-inch diameter casing, the largest drilling-with-casing job in the world; horizontal multi-lateral drilling; use of electric submersible pumps, down hole heating, and hot water injection into the reservoir. The field location can be seen in Figure-1 below.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The Solution Architecture plays a key role and becomes a backbone of entire 10 Solution. The aim of Solution Architecture is to layout high level system design, define the technical solution to business problem and design the overall shape of the solution (Ahmad, et al., 2014). The main aim is to provide a solution infrastructure for operations and engineering team enabling them for a remote field manage- ment. Solution Architecture is a widely used term but can mean different things to different people and is considered as the high-level system design that defines the technical solution to a single business or Information Technology (IT) problem. (Biniwale, Trivedi, Tran, Derrij, &amp; Yokote, 2013). The solution infrastructure for remote field management consists of four physical locations where daily decision is taken for effective operation of the field, starting from offshore platform to Management team in OMV head office as shown in Figure-2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The first component is the automation of data acquisition process from offshore FPSO historian to onshore historian at OMV Wellington office via microwave link as shown in Figure-3. The FPSO acts as the source historian that stores all the raw, validated, and processed data from the various applications and also becomes the source to feed different processes and applications when required.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The Figure 5 below depicts the current solution deployment setup where data is streamed in from historian and after quality check; it is aggregated and stored in data hub. The engineering application is directly integrated with the data hub allowing users to access data immediately when it passes quality control process. Team engineering analysis project is been built applying corporate standards. Administrator with formal approval process can only modify this project. End users can access the corporate analysis template and build their own templates specific to their area of interest or analysis requirement.</p><div id="link-5">
