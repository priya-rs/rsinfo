<p id="Ancr2">The Triassic Yanchang Formation Chang7 Member tight oil reservoir in Ordos Basin, featuring complex pore-throat structures, low porosity, low permeability, rich micro-fractures and low pressure coefficient, is difficult to produce by advanced water-flooding from cluster vertical wells with low individual-well producing rate. With one Block A of Chang-7 tight oil in China as an example (Fig. 1), with the lower formation pressure factor about 0.8 (Fig. 2,Tab. 1). The reservoir’s mid-depth is around 2000m.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">With one Block A of Chang-7 tight oil in China as an example (Fig. 1), with the lower formation pressure factor about 0.8 (Fig. 2,Tab. 1). The reservoir’s mid-depth is around 2000m. The tight oil is currently under primary depletion development with an annual production declining rate higher than 50% at the first year. The water-flood huff and puff in Chang-7 tight oil increase productivity to some degree, however, the recovery rate is low finally.</p><div id="link-2">
