<p id="Ancr3">The petroliferous Barmer Rift Basin is a narrow NNW-SSE graben structure as shown in Figure 01, extending towards north of the prolific Cambay Basin. The northern part of the basin has thick high quality fluvial sandstone reservoirs in the Fatehgarh Formation that overlies the pre-rift basement of Lower Cretaceous. The gross thickness of the Fatehgarh Formation increases in the footwall portions from south to north in the Down-to-the-West (DTTW) fault system. A similar thickness trend is observed in the un-conformably overlying Palaeocene-Eocene Barmer Hill Formation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The Barmer Hill Formation is divided into different members/units as shown in open hole log tracks in Figure 02, based on lithological characteristics (Chowdhury et. al., 2011). In many areas, the formation contains high total organic carbon throughout, with particularly significant organic rich intervals near the base. In the lake settings, particularly in northern part of the basin, upper Barmer Hill is comprised mainly of laminated porcellanite. This unit is 50-250 meters thick and is known to be hydrocarbon bearing within structural closures.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">Figure 06 contains the fall off analysis for the injections in BH-08 ad BH-09. The interpretations indicate that the closure gradient for BH-09 (0.58 psi/ft) is significantly lower than the 0.62 psi/ft gradient estimated for BH-08. This confirmed the microseismic observations that BH-09 is not serving as a barrier for the fracture containment. The general understanding of non-pay sections to act as stress barriers for fracture height containment is ruled out for fracturing key upper BH units i.e BH-10 &amp; BH-08.</p><div id="link-7">

CT hydrajetting created three holes at 120 deg phased holes at each jetting location. In general, 03-04 jetting locations were used for each stage resulting in a total of 9 perforations. Based on the work done by Smith and Larry (see Figure 08), the breakdown pressure for a longitudinal fracture should be about ¾ of the breakdown pressure for a transverse fracture for the given stress state.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr20">For any secondary recovery mechanisms e.g. water-flood, longitudinal wells may be preferred so as to get better flood-front movement and sweep (Pearson et.al.). With a transverse producer well, risk for early water breakthrough may be higher. A pilot test as per Figure 17 is presently being planned to evaluate incremental benefits of water-flooding in Mangala Barmer Hill with a combination of longitudinal and transverse producer well. These results will be analyzed to strategize the field development concept.</p><div id="link-18">
