<p id="Ancr5">An integrated workflow for primary and thermal probabilistic forecast is schematically illustrated in Figure 2. The workflow comprises of three sequential segments to assess the full-field (FF) potential. The first segment of the workflow selects three realizations from a suite of full-field geostatistical realizations. The three selected realizations account for variations in reservoir geology and represent low, mid, and high scenarios of reservoir geology respectively. Additionally, well locations were selected separately for each realization based on surface constraints and well selection algorithm (described below).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr6">The cumulative oil production (OPC) at 50 years from the simulation runs were used to compare the outcomes of various scenarios and rank them. Three perfor-mance curves representing low, mid &amp; high full-field primary production forecast are selected based on cumulative oil production after 50 years. The output from this step was the full-field rate profiles of different phases (oil, water and gas), estimated recovery values, number of producers and well-scheduling using Approach-1 development plan. Figure 3 shows the oil production profiles with the initial ramp up reaching to the target full-field plateau and then decline. Oil recoveries for three cases were 2.4%, 2.8%and 3.8% on the full-field basis OOIP.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">The next and most important step for primary production forecasting is to compare the simulation results with analog data. The analog field was an XHO field with similar geology, but at a greater depth (and therefore, with lower oil viscosity and higher reservoir pressure) and developed using horizontal wells of similar horizontal lengths. Figure 6 compares the cumulative distribution of initial production rates and estimated ultimate recovery at the individual well level in the low, mid &amp; high cases with the analog field data.</p><div id="link-6">

For thermal development scenario, we used reduced well spacing by placing three equally spaced horizontal infills between existing PP producers. This reduces the interwell spacing to 125 meter.

The shale baffles obstruct the flow of oil from the upper regions of the reservoir to the primary producers. Therefore, the presence of baffles reduces the rate of pressure depletion in the upper regions (Figure 13c); higher pressure depletion occurs in the regions below the baffles.

The difference in average pressures in the AOI is about 150 psi during initial cycles and it reduces to about 50 psi towards the end of five years (Fig. 14(a)). The difference in pressure depletions is even less pronounced for Sector-2 (Fig. 14(b)).

<p id="Ancr26">As described above, in the development lifecycle of many heavy-oil reservoirs, thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR) method is preceded by primary production. Long producers (~ 5000 ft. or longer) is typically used during primary production of heavy oil reservoirs. The current art for thermal development would require shorter injectors and producers to be drilled after primary production, which could make thermal recovery commercially non-economic. The proposed well configuration of two shorter injectors per producer (Figure 23) would significantly improve economics of such projects.</p><div id="link-23">
