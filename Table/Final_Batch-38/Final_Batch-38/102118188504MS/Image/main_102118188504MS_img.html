<p id="Ancr3">The oil field produces from a highly fractured carbonate reservoir with high porosity. The PDO field uses the Thermally Assisted Gas-Oil Gravity Drainage (TA-GOGD) method to produce heavy oil with low API and high viscosity. The producing reservoir interval is shallow at ~300 meters below the surface and produces from carbonate formations sealed by shale (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The calculated 4D micro-gravity signal for the 2013 absolute base survey and 2015 relative survey repeat showed an appreciable signal coinciding with the field crest of the structure (Figure 4). Observed micro-gravity data values were differenced to calculate the 4D micro-gravity signal. A small number of anomalous outlier values were removed which reduced the number of observations but was important to stabilize the inversion process. Gravity reduction is observed at the crest of the field reaching about 65 micro-Gals (2015-2013), while gravity increase reaches 40 micro-Gals outside the reservoir boundary.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">The calculated 4D micro-gravity signal for the 2013 absolute base survey and 2016 relative repeat survey showed a similar signature to the 2015-2013 4D signal (Figure 5). However, the 2016-2013 4D signal seem to show lesser data scatter. The latter is perhaps attributed to the improved surveying method and using 2 gravimeters for additional redundancy in the 2016 survey (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Where, Z is surface elevation in meters and ρ is the average near surface rock density (in g/cc). The use of fixed (concrete) monuments enabled very high repeatability of the vertical height of the gravimeter, which removed the need for repeated GPS height determination. Instead, satellite data (InSAR) is used to observe surface subsidence and uplift the field is experiencing, with very high accuracy that is then removed from the observed gravity signal using equation 1. InSAR shows minor uplift, ~1.2cm, at the crest of the field associated with the steam injection area, while parts of the field flanks are experiencing subsidence (Figure 6). Subsidence observed north of the field is attributed to aquifer pump off (Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr9">The method uses Weighted Least Square iterative inversion of the observed gravity data (Glegola et al. 2014). Important inversion parameters used in this data set are cell size of 150mx150mx100m and depth of reservoir at ~300m below the surface. The 100m vertical cell size estimate is the effective reservoir thickness assumed to undergo the 4D density variation. Gravity measurements typically offer poor vertical resolution, as they sum density vertically below the gravity measurement station. Hence, the inversion method needs to keep the degrees of freedom under control, and does this by solving for a 2D linear inverse problem instead of full 3D (Glegola et al. 2014). We use the 4D gravity signal to invert for density change in the reservoir at depth (Figure 7).</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">The code iteratively solves for a minimum misfit between observed and modelled data points. In this inversion we consider 5 µgal value, the CG5 gravimeter detection limit, as the ambient noise level. This number acts as a convergence criterion ("acceptable fit") thereby limiting the number of iterations. The somewhat subjective "optimal" iteration number that we selected for this study is 3, beyond which we consider the inversion is overfitting noise (Figure 8). The inversion results for the 2013 base and 2015 repeat show a density reduction anomaly at the crest of the field (Figure 9). We observe a maximum density reduction of ~31 kg/m3 at a crest, and a density increase of ~11.4kg/m3 outside the field (Figure 9).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr12">Comparably, the 3rd iteration inversion result for the 2013 base and the 2016 repeat show a relatively a changed anomaly shape compared to the 2013 base and repeat 2015 (Figure 10). The anomaly also coincides with the field structure crest. The highest density change is now focused at the center of the anomaly (Figure 10). The anomaly is also continous but shows a lateral north to South asymmetry at the top-left end of the anomaly (Figures 9 &amp; 10). The dent in the top of the anomaly boundary may be attributable to the shallow water aquifer anomaly observed in WMW-2 (Figures 9 &amp; 10). This is shown by the incursion of blue inside the red-yellow anomaly in the top.</p><div id="link-10">
