<p id="Ancr1">The investigation of ways to improve the conventional PDC cutter focused on three areas. First, a conventional PDC cutter is characterized by a "shear-only" cutting mechanism. The durability of the PDC cutter relies heavily on the wear resistance of its diamond. When drilling abrasive formation, the high degree of frictional heat can generate wear flats (Fig. 1) and, in extreme cases, can break down the diamond bond or convert the synthetic diamond back to graphite. Second, a flat working surface can obstruct cuttings from releasing and hamper hydraulic cooling.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">This could lead to an accumulation and/or packing of drilled formation in front of the cutter causing bit balling and jeopardizing drilling efficiency. Moreover, it can also reduce PDC cutter life due to acceleration in thermal degradation of the diamond layer. Third, in hard/interbedded formations, conventional PDC cutters can suffer frontal impact damage (Fig. 2) that could eventually cause bit failure. CDEs could be used to mitigate these issues; however, a higher than normal WOB may not be realistic for extended wells in lateral drilling. It was recognized that a new approach was required to extend the PDC cutter life.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">The innovative design of the RDE combines a standard cylindrical substrate with a modified ridge, or saddle-shape, diamond layer (Fig. 3). With this unique geometry, the cutter can efficiently shear formation, similar to a conventional PDC cutter, and also deliver a crushing action similar to that of a roller cone insert. As illustrated in Fig. 4, when a flat cutter face engages rock, the shear stress is expected to be distributed along the contact zone marked in red. However, when an RDE contacts the rock, its ridge applies a concentrated load around the tip area such that the stress is much higher than the former case with a conventional PDC cutter.</p><div id="link-3">

A single-cutter scrape test was set up and conducted to compare the two different cutter geometries (Fig. 5). When both types of cutting elements were used to shear rocks with different unconfined strengths, it was found that cutting forces and vertical forces recorded on RDE are about 40% less than those observed from a conventional cutter (Fig. 6). Interestingly, the higher the unconfined rock strength, the more reduction in force is recorded, ranking from the softest Wellington Shale to the hardest Utah Lake Limestone.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">In addition to the rock/cutter mechanic tests, both cutters were also subjected to a rock-shearing test on a VTL to further evaluate the performance differences. In this test, a PDC cutter is fixed on a lathe holder and then it is set at a certain depth of cut (DOC), typically approximately 0.020 in. to 0.050 in., to remove granite from a large granite log (Fig. 7) spinning at certain RPM. Cutting the granite from outer diameter to inner diameter (OD to ID) at a certain DOC concludes one pass on the granite, and the same cutting sequence continues until the cutter dulls when the weight on cutter is over a preset value or a certain predetermined pass number is reached.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr11">The North American Midcontinent Granite Wash play, depicted in Fig. 11, comprises a series of tight gas targeted formations expanding from Southwest Oklahoma across the Texas Panhandle. The reservoir is roughly 160 miles long and 30 miles wide, extending from western Washita County, Oklahoma, to Gray and Roberts counties, Texas. In this play, conventional vertical drilling practices have, for the most part, given way to more modern horizontal drilling production. The Granite Wash reservoir comprises shales and sandstones, which can include quartz and feldspar.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr12">These formations possess unconfined compressive strengths (UCS) on the order of 5,000 psi to 25,000 psi and include stringers with UCS that can exceed 30,000 psi. These interbedded formations, observed in Fig. 12, were traditionally and formerly drilled with conventional roller cone technology, and still present a challenge for today's modern, fixed-cutter PDC bits. For the operators to complete and produce each well economically, each interval must be drilled as efficiently as possible. The specific drilling intervals of the Granite Wash play that consist of many different formation types and the wide-ranging UCS represent a positive testing ground for a more efficient cutting mechanism such as the RDE.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr21">On the very first run with the 6-in RDE bit, the operator was able to drill the entire 3-mile lateral in one run, setting a world record for the most footage drilled by a single 6-in drill bit. The RDE bit drilled 15,340 ft and graded out a 1-2-WT-S-X-O-CT-TD. On the fourth Middle Bakken lateral, the operator set a new world record for the most footage drilled on a single 6-in drill bit run with the RDE drill bit. The RDE drill bit on the fourth Middle Bakken lateral drilled 15,375 ft in one run, and the dull bit was graded 1-3-SPA-S-X-0-NO-TD (Fig. 21).</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr22">Trackability of a BHA when drilling laterals in the Williston basin is very significant to operators. Most operators in the Williston basin drill laterals on a bent motor assemble. In order to change direction in the lateral with a bent motor, the driller has to slide the BHA in the direction in which he wants to achieve. Slide ROP can be as much as 90% less than rotating ROP. The operator was able to reduce slide footage by an average of 45% and reduce slide time by an average of 31% (Fig 22 &amp; Fig. 23) resulting in a 9% reduction (11 total hours) in overall drilling hours needed to reach the end of the lateral.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr24">The second metric where the RDE bit outperformed the PDC bit was in mitigating lateral shock. Shock is characterized as a violent shake or vibration. When violent shaking or vibration occurs in a drill string in a direction perpendicular to the wellbore this is known as ‘lateral shock’. Lateral shock is often the most damaging type of vibration due to the relatively high force magnitudes compared to axial shock (vibration acting parallel to the wellbore) or torsional shock (vibration acting rotationally). A measurement while drilling (MWD) tool is commonly used in a BHA to record and track the shock and vibration seen downhole. The lateral shock data recorded by the MWD tool from the operator's three lateral wells is shown on Fig.24.</p><div id="link-24">
