<p id="Ancr7">It is speculated that the ROZ was originally a portion of a larger oil entrapment, but the oil was displaced by water influx over geological time resulting in remaining oil saturations of up to 40% in some areas (Harouaka et al. 2013). The peculiarity of the ROZ, however, is that the remaining trapped and immobile oil becomes mobile only upon contact with miscible CO2 or depressurization. The amount of oil, if recovered can be a significant contribution to the economics of the production operations. Fig. 1 shows a typical saturation-depth profile from the San Andres Limestone of the Permian Basin.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">The East Seminole Field covers approximately 2,000 acres in Gaines County, Texas, USA and includes both the East Seminole San Andres Unit (ESSAU) and the Lindoss Unit. The field lies on the northeastern edge of the Central Basin Platform (Fig. 2a) and produces from a succession of anticlinal traps in the San Andres dolomite. Core data revealed that the bulk of the San Andres reservoir rock contains subtidal fusulinid pack/grainstones and intertidal pelleted wacke/packstones in a shallowing upward sequence.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr9">In fields that have been waterflooded, such as the East Seminole Field, resistivity responses became increasingly difficult to interpret as the mixing of the injected and formation water altered the water salinity. This results in difficulties with distinguishing the MP from the ROZ and in unreliable fluid saturation calculations. In fact, resistivity log responses RD, RS, and RMML from the wells studied showed no significant difference between the MP and ROZ and remained between 20 and100 ohm-meters (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

Next, the number of processing elements in the second hidden layer was varied between 23 and 27, while the number of processing elements in the first hidden layer was set to 30. The minimum MSE was 0.05938 for training, with 25 processing elements in the second hidden layer.

<p id="Ancr13">To further test the network and to measure the relative importance of the inputs of the ANN model on output performance, a sensitivity analysis about the mean of each of the inputs was carried out. This analysis demonstrates how the model output varies in response to variation of an input. During this analysis, the inputs were varied around their mean by adding and subtracting one standard deviation, while keeping all other inputs at their respective mean values. The output was computed for 50 steps greater than and less than the mean value of the varied input. The results of the test are shown in Table 3 and in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr14">Fig. 8 compares the target oil saturations in the testing and training data set with the predicted values. The comparison of the target data with the predicted values in these figures show that the performance of the network in predicting ROS is reasonable despite the large variations in the data. As expected, predicted values for the training data are in better agreement with the target values with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.87 and MSE of 34.6. The minimum and maximum absolute errors with training data set were 0.02% and 19.8%, respectively.</p><div id="link-8">
