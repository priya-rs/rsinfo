<p id="Ancr6">Initially, the history match was done for only observed pressures and production data. A good reservoir-wide match for pressure, gas production and water cut was obtained (Figure 4). On the well level, seven of the wells had fair-to-good water cut match while two wells (HC-104 and HA-30) had poor water cut match. The model could not match the water breakthrough in HC-104 even after five years of actual water production. In addition the model produced excessive water in HA-30 even though the well never produced water in its production life.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">See Figures 5 and 6 for the pressure/production history match plots for HC-104 and HA-30, respectively. Attempts were made to improve the history match by adjusting residual oil saturation, but to no avail. It was then decided to check the model performance with respect to matching observed fluid-contacts in the wells. The result showed that only two wells had fair-to-good fluid-contact match in both HA and HC zones while the rest of the wells (six) had poor fluid-contact match. It was then decided to actively history match the fluid-contact in addition to pressure and production.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr17">After the permeability adjustment, there was significant improvement in the fluid-contact match for the six wells that earlier had poor fluid-contact match (See Figures 11–18 for the fluid contact/RFT pressure matches). Table 1 shows the comparison between the water cut history match for the case of only matching pressure and production and for the case of matching pressure, production and fluid contact. Similarly, Table 2 shows the comparison for the fluid-contact match for the two cases.</p><div id="link-15">

<p id="Ancr20">Simulation-derived average oil saturation maps (at the end of history) were prepared for the HA zone and HC zone respectively. Based on the average oil saturation maps, one new drill and three workover opportunities were identified (Figures 19 and 20). These opportunities were then assessed with the history-matched simulation model. Based on the simulation model, the do-nothing case oil recovery factor is 56.5% of original oil in place, while the incremental oil recovery from the identified opportunities is 7.5% of original oil in place. Thus, the total estimated oil recovery factor with the identified opportunities is 64% of original oil in place.</p><div id="link-18">
