<p id="Ancr9">Figure 1 (a) shows the rheological profiles of untriggered and triggered polymer and demonstrates that, in its untriggered form, the inverted polymer in SSW has water-like viscosity. In comparison, the triggered polymer solution has a viscosity commensurate with an HPAM polymer of equivalent molecular weight and concentration. It can also be seen that the untriggered polymer acts a Newtonian fluid – that is, it is unaffected by shear. Once triggered, the polymer backbone is extended and indistinguishable from HPAM and therefore demonstrates the same non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviour.</p><div id="link-1">

Water was first injected for 43 days, in order to create a cooled zone around the well, as would occur in real field applications, and to provide baseline performance. Polymer was then injected for 43 days and was followed by 24 days of chase water injection. The final stage of the test was to examine the impact of shutting in the well for a significant period during polymer injection. For this purpose, polymer injection was restored for 3 days, followed by a shut-in period of 3 days, and then chase water.</p><div id="link-4">

The global skin factor of +25 will include an element due to near-well cooling, but implies a mechanical skin factor of about+15, which demonstrates a high level of damage from solids and/or fluids during drilling and completion. This is likely as the reservoir is under-pressured.

<p id="Ancr20">To derive the pre-exponential factor and activation energies we have used viscosity-trends with time and temperature from laboratory bottle-tests. The rate response appears to be different at different temperatures, which has required us to model the reaction with a temperature-dependent activation energy where each temperature range uses the Arrhenius dependence of the rate constant on temperature. The match to viscosity trends with time is shown in Figure 12 (a) and is acceptable in the range of temperatures present in the model. Note that at 50°C the kinetic model is slower than measured data, whilst at 70°C the viscosification is quicker. However, at the temperatures present in the model the match is acceptable.</p><div id="link-12">

Whilst retention may be due to adsorption to solid surfaces or trapping within small pores, both mechanisms lead to a delay in propagation.

<p id="Ancr22">The basic rock properties and dispersivity in the model were tuned using the salinity of the effluent and concentrations of the waterflood tracer in wellhead samples during the waterflood phase of the trial. The match to the swept volume is accurate, and, as shown in Figure 14, the qualitative changes in salinity and tracer concentration in response to well control events are captured in the model. The skin of the injector and total compressibility were further guided by PTA. We found it was important to carefully tune the total compressibility in the model to provide an adequate match during periods when injection and/or production rates were changing. PFO2 at the end of the waterflood phase was also simulated using the reservoir model and a comparison with field data is shown in Figure 11.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr28">The trial described in this paper was the shortest in duration and injected the smallest mass of polymer but it compares favourably with other trials given the thickness of the reservoir interval. The quantity of polymer injected, in mass per unit area, was greater than, or of the same order as, other trials. The number of pore volumes injected through a 10-m radius around the injector was similar to the Matzen trial and significantly greater than others (see Figure 20). Injectivity reduction is a particular concern during polymer trials. In other trials, there was evidence of declining injectivity over time, attributed to the shear-thickening behaviour of HPAM polymers in the high-shear near-wellbore region (Lotfollahi, et al. 2016). Despite the comparable injection quantity, no injectivity decline was seen with this polymer; and the polymer backbones were protected when passing through the high-shear region.</p><div id="link-20">
