Average ROS in the areas of good formation permeability ranges from 30% to 45% (Figure 2). However, areas of ROS higher than 45% can be observed at relatively low permeability areas (&lt; 10 mD), using advanced drilling technologies might be the proper way to produce this high remaining oil.

Consequently, another regions’ definition was generated as shown in Figure 7. An alternative region definition was generated and determined by observing the maximum sweep of surfactant at a concentration of 1E-20 lb/stb.

It is well distinguished that low injection rate (500 b/d) could maintain a stable water/surfactant front which will result in a better sweep efficiency. This stable front was estimated at distance of 260 m away from the injector. Considering the number of cells where the surfactant arrives as displayed in Figure 11 (total active cells: 17545) in comparison to where surfactant becomes active (total active cells: 367).
