Currently, three pilot projects are ongoing: polymer flooding, Thermally Activated Particle (TAP) treatment (Maffeis et al., 2017) and Low salinity waterflooding (Callegaro et al., 2015). Pilots’ outcome will set the foundations for a future EOR full-field application, which foresees a combination of different technologies.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The work herein presented concerns the polymer inter-well pilot project in a selected area of the field. This area was identified for chemical EOR implementation due to good petrophysical properties and geological characterization, moderate recovery factor, low formation temperature, and adeguate well spacing. A depth map of the area is depicted in Figure 2. Extensive reservoir surveillance was established to monitor reservoir performance before and after polymer injection.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">In February 2016, after an initial ramp-up phase, continuous polymer injection started at 1000 bbl/day and 1500 ppm of concentration. This corresponds to the target viscosity of 5 cP at Reservoir Conditions (RC), defined to decrease the oil-water mobility ratio below 1 (Braccalenti et al., 2013). Figure 3a reports the Bottomhole Pressure (BHP) and injection rate during the start-up (from 9 to 15 February 2016), while Figure 3b shows the behavior of well parameters during the monitored period.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">Figure 6 shows the main results of the analysis. Because the perforation radius and the tunnel length are uncertain variables, sensitivities were considered by varying these two parameters. Furthermore, the perforation efficiency, i.e. the area of a perforation open to flow, was considered uncertain too. Assuming a worst-case scenario where the perforation efficiency is 50%, and the shear rate threshold is 60 000 s-1, no evidence of mechanical degradation is detected. Indeed, within common ranges of perforation radius and tunnel length values (perforation radius &gt; 0.31 in and tunnel length &gt; 5.5 in), the estimated equivalent shear rate lies below the assumed upper threshold.</p><div id="link-6">

It allowed us monitoring the in-situ polymer viscosity, the polymer front advancement, and eventually induced-fractures presence.

<p id="Ancr10">The first FO analyzed for the polymer system was recorded after 2 months of injection. The results obtained show two different radial stabilization: it was assumed that the first Infinite Acting Radial Flow (IARF) was referred to the near-wellbore zone flooded by the polymer, while the outlet zone was still saturated by water. The second FO (recorded after 7 months of polymer injection) shows the slope changing of the derivative after the first stabilization but the second IARF was not reached within the radius of investigation. The transmissibility value (kh/μ) was calculated by matching the FO pressure behavior and the Horner plot. Figure 9 reports the interpretation model and the achieved match with the observed data for the two polymer injection FOs.

<p id="Ancr11">By inspection of both Table 1 and Figure 10, it is noted that the mobility decreased because of the fluid viscosity increased during polymer injection. The effective polymer viscosity acting into the reservoir can be estimated by the transmissibility (kh/μ) ratio between the polymer and the water system. Assuming a water viscosity of 0.5 cP, the resulting in-situ average polymer viscosity is 2.8 cP after 2 months and 5 cP after 7 months. The radial composite system for the polymer interpretation could be considered as the transition from the polymer to the water zone into the reservoir. Transition from polymer to water zone occurs at around 50 m after 2 months and at 230 m after 7 months of injection. Induced-fractures presence during polymer injection is suggested by a negative skin, but the fracture propagation is not evident in the derivative pressure behavior.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr14">In our context, a main FO period was analyzed. The pressure data were interpreted through specialized plot, such as the SQRT versus time, G-function, and the log-log plot. This allowed us to estimate the closure pressure, i.e. the fluid pressure needed to initiate the re-opening of a fracture, and the breakdown pressure, i.e. the fluid pressure required to initiate a fracture in intact rock. The latter was estimated to be 3000 psi, which is in fair agreement with the FPP evaluation from BHP vs. injection rate plot (3100 psi). Main conclusions are illustrated in Fig. 13 and summarized as follows:</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">From a practical standpoint, the model was used to reproduce the injection history during water and polymer injection. Injection rate and polymer injection concentration are specified, while the BHP is simulated, and compared with down-hole gauge measurements. Figure 14 shows the main simulation results. The model was firstly effectively calibrated during the water injection phase. During polymer injection, it is evident from Figure 14 that if injection in matrix conditions is assumed, the BHP trend is not matched (red curve). In particular, simulated BHP exceeds the downhole measurements (grey dots). In the light of the previous considerations, we decided to explore the possibility to inject in fracturing conditions. A progressive transmissibility improvement within the near-wellbore zone (~1.5 m) was then implemented as a simplified approach for fracture modeling. With this implementation, it is noted that the BHP is finally matched also during the polymer injection phase (black curve).</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr19">Figure 18 is an enlargement of the near-wellbore zone viscosity distribution during the start-up phase. Within this zone, the viscosity covers a wide range of values. In correspondence of the perforations, the viscosity is low, due to the high shear rate conditions that characterize this area. Moving away from the wellbore, as the polymer enters deeply in the reservoir, it tends to recover its viscosity due to velocity decrease. A transition zone characterized by dilution of polymer concentration due to seawater is then detected. Here the viscosity assumes intermediate values between the seawater and the undisturbed viscosity. The zones where the highest viscosity is found are those under the perforations, identified as stagnant zones where the polymer is stationary.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr20">In the analysed pilot robust reservoir monitoring is ongoing since the pilot start-up date, and preliminary promising EOR effects are arising at pilot producers. Two examples of the production performance analysis are reported in Figure 19 where the remarkable reduction in watercut and the oil rate increase at two monitored producers are evident. Based on these promising results, a potential full field extension is currently under evaluation.</p><div id="link-19">
