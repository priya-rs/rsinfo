<p id="Ancr9">The Permian Basin (Figure 1) continues to be the most prolific oil producing region in the nation (EIA, 2017). Continued advancements in hydraulic fracturing techniques, horizontal drilling and advanced diagnostic tools have greatly increased development in unconventional reservoirs. The previous work, SPE 175535 (Parker et al., 2015) discussed traditional fracture optimization methods and design variables including fluid and proppant selection and fracture conductivity enhancement to promote well performance improvements and introduced stage size, cluster spacing and perforation efficiency design methods.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">The engineered design methodology discussed resulted in significant improvements to well performance, allowed for a systematic method to validate parameters and provided the basis-of-design for benchmarking well performance. Key parameters, engineering tools and methods are necessary to evaluate completion efficiency and hydrocarbon productivity of the reservoir in order to design optimal fracture treatments in unconventional reservoirs (Meyer et al., 2013). Figure 2 shows the locations of Wells A-F and offset technology Well G in Reeves County, Texas, used in this study.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr14">However, there is a marked difference in the complex back stress. This is because the hybrid completions utilized crosslink fluid and larger grain proppant (20/40 or greater) compared to the current smaller grain proppant (40/70 or less) and slickwater type design. The secondary and tertiary fracture apertures were created with a significantly more viscous fluid than slickwater and more pressure was generated.
