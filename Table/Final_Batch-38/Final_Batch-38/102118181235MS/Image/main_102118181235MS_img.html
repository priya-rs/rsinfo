<p id="Ancr4">Many hydraulically-powered pumps for AL have been designed and operated in the course of the Industry. Several variations are described in Brown (1980), Fretwell (2007), and Pugh (2006), among others. This discussion will focus on the direct lineage of the SRVP in order from lower to higher maximum pumping volumes and operational depths (Furrow et al. 2012). Fig. 1 compares the theoretical production rates of the various Cormorant systems versus operational depths (Bolt 2012).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The SRVP is installed downhole inside a concentric tubing string and is powered by injecting a high pressure fluid. The injected (power) fluid causes a signal rod to extend/retract within a pilot-operated shuttle (engine) valve (Fig. 2). At the conclusion of the signal rod’s stroke, indentations in the signal rod cause the engine valve to shift from a “Home” to a “Forward” position or vice versa. The engine valve’s inlet/discharge flow paths are reversed in the Home/Forward configurations, allowing power fluid to be routed to the appropriate side of a power piston.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr22">The SRVP 3 teardown uncovered some debris in the engine valve and some large material (suspected to be seal springs) that had entered the water section intake (Fig. 19). The combination of debris and water section blockage/wear likely resulted in reduced efficiency near the end of the pumping period. The SRVP components were operational following cleaning of the engine valve. The SRVP 3 engine valve was the same as was run in SRVP 1.</p><div id="link-19">
