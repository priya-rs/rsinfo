<p id="Ancr1">When solving Eq. 2 for an injector, the sign of v is reversed. The historical time average tracer concentration for a producer well, and the control volumes for all wells can be observed in Fig. 1. It is important to point out that Eq. 2 is valid for both incompressible and compressible flow. Shahvali et al. (2012) on the other hand solved for ∇ · (vc) = 0 because of its natural conservative form. The two tracer algorithms are identical for incompressible case ∇ · v = 0; however, ∇ · (vc) = 0 will fail in compressible cases.</p><div id="102118185614MS-Img_SPi-1">

A graphical representation of the blocks may be seen in Fig. 2 (right). The oil API gravity is around 31 degrees and porosity and permeability are within 14-18 percent and 12-19 mD respectively.</p><div id="link-2">

This way asset teams can easily visualize the evolution of the field, including production and injection rates, as well as efficiencies and strength of connections. The production and injection rates for January of 1996 and 2006 can be seen in Fig. 3. The size of the pie is proportional to the rate, while the ratio between green and blue, for a production well, provides the oil-water ratio.</p><div id="102118185614MS-Img_SPi-3">

<p id="Ancr4">To fully understand how injectors are providing support to nearby producers, connection strengths and efficiencies must be studied. As described previously, connection strengths are given by a numerical tracer test and connection efficiencies are calibrated upon it. The tracer provides information on the volume and strength of influence affected by the producer or injector. For example, in Fig. 4 we can observe the tracer evolution for a producer well over the course of 16 years.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">The tracer concentration, similar to the spatial distribution density of streamlines, can provide a very powerful graphical representation of the reservoir dynamics. Yet, visualizing the tracer concentrations for each well can become overwhelming and finding an optimization strategy is difficult. To have a better understanding of how injectors are providing support, a subsurface network connectivity map based on the WAF and efficiency can be created, thus simplifying the analysis from three dimension to two. Fig. 5 shows the connectivity map for January of 1951 and 1971.</p><div id="102118185614MS-Img_SPi-5">

<p id="Ancr6">The connectivity map can provide immediate assessment as to which injectors are the most effective and if certain regions of the reservoir are not receiving enough support. An interesting observation is that some of the injectors do not have any connections to nearby producers. Instead, these injectors appear to be injecting into the aquifer. This could be part of an injection strategy to increase the aquifer support, but it could also point towards inefficient injectors. The connectivity of each individual injector or producer can also be visualized, as seen in Fig. 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">For confidentiality of current production rates, the optimization scenarios are based on historical field production and not the current rates. Reported changes of performance are strictly contrasted to the production and injection data of May 1997. At this point in time, the field was producing 16.4 MBBL/D of 31 API oil at 51.4 percent water cut, with 223 producer and 60 injector wells. The total water injection was of 121.4 MBBL/D. Fig. 7 shows the location of producers and injectors, along with the rate associated with each. Injection is mainly distributed along blocks one and two.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Two types of optimization scenarios are shown, one for the entire field and one focused on block three, which has the weakest but most efficient wells. The first is a very loose optimization where all injectors and producers will be allowed to change rates. The constraints for all wells are half to 1.5 of their rate (as of May 1997), with a minimum oil target of 17.2 MBBL/D, which represents a 5% increase. While the authors understand that modifying hundreds of wells that expand over nearly 130 square kilometers is not realistic, the scenario is shown to showcase how the optimizer handles extremely complex problems. As mentioned previously, the results are compared to the field performance of May 1997. Fig. 8 shows the optimized results along with the inter-well connections that have WAF larger than 20 percent.</p><div id="102118185614MS-Img_SPi-8">
