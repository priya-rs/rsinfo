From these cores 11 samples were selected for X - Ray diffraction (XRD) analysis and calculate the total organic carbon (TOC). The area of interest has 5 2D seismic surveys disposed in different orientations, covering a total of 53 seismic lines and 4 wells with checkshot data (fig. 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr10">The lower La Grita Member of Early Cretaceous Capacho Formation was deposited on western Venezuela which span from uppermost Albian to Cenomanian. Its statigraphic limits are established at top with Seboruco Member of Cenomanian and at base with Aguardiente Formation of Aptian - Albian (fig. 3). It has a wide distribution in some states such as Zulia, T´chira and Mérida. Also, this member has an average thickness above 80 feet (24.38 m), increasing progressively at south.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr13">Figure 6 shows a stratigraphic section in direction of the sedimentation, SW – NE. In this section can be noticed as La Grita Member gradually thins at northeast, while that at southwest the stratigraphic unit increases or thickens specifically in the deposits of calcareous shale. Also, the figure exhibits the continuity of level of bioclastic limestones at base of unit representing an important marker in the area.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr14">Also, TOC was derivated from resistivity logs, transit time, formation density and neutron according to methodology of Passey et al. (1990). The level of maturity (LOM) was estimated at 10.2 corresponding to a state of full maturity of kerogen in the interval. As a result, it generated a curve of TOC using the logs of well P_B1, which oscillate between values of 4 to 8% into La Grita Member (fig. 7). This curve created fits with the values of geochemical data obtained of core samples, confirming the organic richness of the stratigraphic unit of interest.</p><div id="link-7">

The mineralogical distribution viewing in the diagram ternary shows a mixture between quartz/feldspars and calcite, indicating a kind of rock with low content of clay and good conditions for fracturing.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr17">Moreover, the brittleness analysis was developed using the methodology of Grieser and Bray (2007) and Kuuskraa et al. (2013), both indicated that the stratigraphic unit of interest can be classified as brittle. Figure 10 shows that the values of Poisson’s ratio and Young’s modulus of La Grita Member have been located in the brittle region. This result made match with the brittleness index determined by mineralogical analysis, wich has an average fraction of 0.77.</p><div id="link-10">
