<p id="Ancr1">This is to assure that gas deliverability can be maintained above the Daily Contractual Quantity (DCQ) for the next 6-12 months with the current operation schedule. Figure 1 depicts the example of a medium-term profile which is subjected to an arbitrary well intervention schedule. The conventional process primarily relied on performing DCA of all wells. Then the DCQ would be achieved by trying to produce wells proportionally without selective production. Therefore, it was laborious and did not capture the nature of field management in which wells are selectively produced based on their values in petroleum fluids.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">In order to select the best field development plan (FDP), production and potential profile until the end of field life must be evaluated. Traditionally, commercialized material balance software was used. Nevertheless, the constructing of the field model and running simulations might be time-consuming. Figure 2 shows an example of this kind of forecast where each line represents a potential profile from one of the development scenarios in which the company is interested.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Wherever the history of the field suggests that condensate-gas ratio (CGR) and water-gas ratio (WGR) tend to change with cumulative gas production (Yu 2014), equations similar to Eq. 10 for those two parameters can be constructed and applied in the same manner. The processes to update gas potential, CGR, and WGR at the end of time step t are illustrated in Figure 3. This example shows the case when gas potential denoted by qg, max and WGR change with time in a linear trend while CGR is constant.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">For illustrating the benefit of the software in snapshot optimization, we collect the well data which we used to perform the conventional optimization approach in the past and optimize it with LINOPT. Figure 6 shows the plot of the target from our conventional approach (line with black markers), and actual condensate potential from LINOPT (black dashed line) over 6 months in the past. The actual sales condensate line (green line) is viewed as a quality control to ensure that the field was operated in the similar manner as the production plan from the conventional approach.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Zawtika field, a dry gas field in offshore Myanmar, started production in 2014 with DCQ over 250 MMscf/D. While it is not relatively heterogeneous or geologically complicated compared with the reservoirs in Arthit, it has several unconsolidated reservoirs resulting in high risk of sand production (Junmano et.al 2016). Consequently, the main challenge here is to make sure that all wells, while serving enough gas for DCQ, are producing at sand free rates. The Zawtika map is shown in the Figure 10.</p><div id="link-10">
