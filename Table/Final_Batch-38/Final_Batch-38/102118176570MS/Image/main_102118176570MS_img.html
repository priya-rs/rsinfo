<p id="Ancr3">Since 2001 the UV1 formation has seen widespread fracturing operations that led to more than twofold increase in fluid production. To compensate for the production, under conditions of decreased reservoir pressure from initial 245 to 205 atm, a contour waterflooding was organized (fig. 1) with significant overcompensation from 2005 to 2007 and subsequent regrowth of injection starting from 2010. The minimum of reservoir pressure (198 atm) was passed in 2009.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">To grasp the extent of technogenic fracture distribution and remove the uncertainties of the current saturation in the western part of the UV1 formation we conducted tracer tests in injection wells 2073 and 873. Results showed (fig. 3, table A1, A2) significant tracer velocities for all studied wells. Thus, the average velocity of tracer lies in the range from 50 to 200 m/h with a maximum of 582 m/h. The permeability of defined low fluid flow resistance channels averaged 340D, with the actual 30 mD obtained on core samples. The reservoir type was determined to be porous with technogenic fracturing.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The radius of the area in which each production well was compared with injection well was set to 1.5km. The correlation coefficients were averaged in 15° sectors with cumulative oil production as weights (fig. 5). The symmetry of the picture is provided by the logical assumption that the change of fluid flow to the opposite (by virtually swapping production and injection wells) will not alter the conductivity of the formation.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr14">Given that practically all production wells are hydraulically fractured (here we assume that fractures extend vertically in the reservoir establishing connection with tight layers outside perforation intervals) we map wells (fig. 12) which totally lack tight layers. When comparing fig. 6 and fig. 11, 12 we can see a correlation (central northern part of the reservoir) between the lack of tight layers in the perforation interval and small values of Spearman correlation coefficient, which is indirect proof of the existence of the direct link of tight, conductive (as a result of plastic deformation during formation development) layers and high fluid flow rates associated with them.</p><div id="link-12">
