Since the initial drilling, field performance, well control and 3D seismic have identified and mapped over 6,000 normal faults. (Fig. 4). The faults are labeled as sealing, baffling or transmitting based on fault throw, well performance, inter-well fluid transit time during water-alternating-gas (WAG) cycles, and inter-well tracer studies. Field development progressed from initial startup of five drill sites in 1981 to forty-four drill sites containing more than 1,100 wells under waterflood (WF), miscible gas injection alternating water (MWAG), or immiscible (lean) gas alternating water (IWAG) into the C-sand or the A-sand, or both.</p><div id="link-4">

This clearly indicates to be on the high side compared to other Kuparuk injection wells. In addition to the injectivity response, careful monitoring of the offset producers showed very rapid communication during MIWAG cycles. This rapid communication relationship can easily be seen on an injector to producer response chart shown in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">An interwell tracer study was started in well I-1 in 2007 and 30.2% of the injected tracer was recovered in the 3 nearby producers as shown in Fig. 8. Although the tracer breakthroughs are strong, moderate and weak in character, there is potential that the lack of early time sampling resulted in missing high concentration samples, thereby significantly underestimating the percent of flow to each well. The sample frequency used resulted in producer P-1 estimating tracer recovery at 17.5% and P-2 recovering 11.4% of the tracer, while producer P-3 recovered only 1.4%.</p><div id="link-8">

Fig. 12a compares the treatment options: 1) treat injector I-1 only; 2) treat both I-1 and I-3. The solid curve is the base case; the short dash curve treating I-1 only; and the long curve represents the forecast when both I-1 and I-3 are treated. Although the void space conduit runs through all three wells, most of the incremental oil and reduction in water production benefits are from the I-1 treatment. Treating I-3 does not add much benefit. Therefore, the conformance solution only targeted well I-1.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr15">When dealing with conformance control issues, a clear understanding of all aspect of the problem is paramount to designing an effective solution (Smith, Ott 2006). First the feature clearly exhibits the behavior of VSC flow. Aspects of this problem were used with the solution overlay shown to be effective in the problem solution matrix identified by Smith and Ott 2006, and updated by Smith in Fig. 13. This problem matrix shows that when natural fracture VSC systems are deep, mechanical systems cannot be employed to gain effective stand-off from the feature.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr16">o eliminate issues with running transport deliveries of produced water, it was decided to use a nearby injector I-2 (next to I-1 on the same pad) to supply the bulk of the make-up water needed to produce gel to be injected into I-1. A hardline (spur line) was constructed to pipe produced water from the flow cross on the I-2 wellhead directly to the I-1 wellhead to inject it down I-1 (see site layout of rig up in Fig. 14). This rig up also required that a gel line be tied into the spur line to slipstream in concentrated gel to blend with the bulk of the make-up water coming from I-2. Essentially, a very concentrated gelant mix was being created by drawing cleaned produced water from 400 bbls upright tanks on location that were being filled by only ~four transport deliveries per day of PW (4 x 290 bbls transports could supply ~1,160 bwpd to tanks per day).</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr18">The implementation of the conformance treatment had an immediate effect on the injectivity of the well. Fig. 16 shows the hall plot of I-1, which clearly shows that injectivity went down after the conformance treatment. In addition to plugging the VSC feature, some damage of matrix permeability in the L2 lateral is possible with limited penetration of polymer. Leak-off of polymer and matrix permeability damage in the L2 lateral was minimized by using a high MW polymer.</p><div id="link-16">

<p id="Ancr20">Fig. 18 plots the sum of oil production rate for all the offset producers as a function of time. Once again it is very difficult to estimate incremental oil from this plot because of the noise and cyclical nature of oil production that occurs in WAG patterns. There was also a sharp drop in oil production rate that occurred due to lack of MI gas injection in all injectors on the same pad as well I-1. This further complicated the analysis because it reduces the incremental oil benefit from the conformance treatment, even though the drop in oil rate had no connection to the conformance treatment.</p><div id="link-18">

This figure shows that much of the noise has been filtered out and a clear response is seen in the cum oil production. Since the slope of the cum oil plot represents the average rate of oil production, any change in slope would indicate an incremental change in oil rate. Initially a change in slope is clearly observed, however due of the lack of MI injection in the area the incremental oil rate benefit was lost temporarily. Once the gas injection was back on line, the cum oil plot again turned a corner and the slope was higher compared to the baseline.</p><div id="link-19">

<p id="Ancr22">The most unequivocal proof of the success of this treatment, where the aspect of improved injection efficiency is captured, can be obtained by plotting cum oil recovery as a function of total pore volume of fluids injected in the pattern. This is shown in Fig. 20. After the conformance treatment a clear change in the slope of the plot is observed, indicating that more oil is recovered with less injection. It can be argued that one reason for the change in this plot after the conformance treatment is because of increased I-1 down-time and transient effects as the well was coming back into a more regular injection pattern after the conformance treatment.</p><div id="link-20">
