<p id="Ancr1">This project began with the intention to expand the limits of an eight-well project spacing test in Niobrara A, B, and C benches to determine optimum well spacing while applying NWB and far-field diagnostic tools to evaluate performance. Fig. 1 shows an extensive survey of the available monitoring tools and their application, which would be compiled collaboratively by the service provider and operator, based on the project. This matrix approach to defining the applicability of a number of NWB and far-field diagnostic tools was used to help prioritize the best tools for evaluation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The treatment well order (Fig. 2) was decided with the objective of maximizing learnings. 1942 well was treated first. Next, Wells 1943 and 1947 were “zipper” fractured to measure the effect of interference on the farthest wells and between the A and C benches. Wells 1941 and 1948 were then zipper fractured to measure interference between the B and C benches. Well 1944 had the microseismic monitoring (MSM) downhole array and was treated last.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">Further, the diverter stages could be divided into pre- and post-diverter stages to understand the fluid distribution change. In Fig. 7, the top chart shows “prediverter” flow allocation and the lower chart shows “post-diverter” flow allocation among the three clusters. To better understand the distribution pre- and post-diverter drops with DTS, quantitative profiling is necessary because qualitative temperatures can be misleading as a result of NWB cooling and short warmback, when rates might be lowered to drop the diverters. At the time of completion and execution of the project (2014-2015), DTS was being used to quantify the volumetric contributions. Since then, rapid advancements have taken place in DAS and currently DAS is used as the primary quantified diagnostics for fluid and proppant.</p><div id="link-7">

The comparatively shorter fracture heights recorded in Wells 1945 and 1946 vs. those noted in Wells 1947 and 1948 could be related to the stimulation sequence, as Wells 1945 and 1946 were stimulated last. These data could also be used to improve the interpretation of microseismic data for the project. Microseismic height interpretations for stages outside of the viewing distance of the hybrid array could be calibrated by the hybrid array stages.</p><div id="link-9">
