<p id="Ancr2">The Karachaganak structure is a carbonate massif comprising a heterogeneous reef and platform carbonate complex measuring approximately 30 km by 15 km. The field is located on the northern margin of the Pre-Caspian Basin which contains a number of world-class hydrocarbon discoveries, including Tengiz, Astrakhan, Kashagan and Orenburg fields (Fig.1) (Kassenov et. al 2016).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">The reservoir has a maximum hydrocarbon column of about 1650 metres. The top of the hydrocarbon bearing reservoir is located at depths ranging from circa −3500 metres TVDSS down to the oil-water contact (OWC) at −5165 metres TVDSS. Within this interval, the reservoir age ranges from Late Devonian to Early Permian. The principal reservoir intervals, the Permian and Carboniferous to the C9 horizon, range in thickness up to approximately 900m and 700m respectively. As per development point of view the reservoir is divided into three Objects (Fig.2). Object 1 and 2 are gas condensate reservoir within Permian and Carboniferous respectively, while Object 3 is the oil leg which is in equilibrium with the overlying gas condensate. There is an essential fluid compositional gradient change with depth as well as areal variation of fluid properties. At present Object 3 is identified as the main target of production.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">Some of these clinoform geometries appear to provide important lateral pressure baffles, and it is likely that these are related to cementation along marine hard-grounds. On a horizontal seismic slice through the latest 3D seismic volume these progradational clinoform geometries appear as of a circular shape similar to the pattern encountered when an onion is sliced (Fig. 3). The topographic low areas between the mound complexes were infilled by the progradation sub-stage deposits during the migration of the biohermal complexes towards the margin of the platform. During the progradation sub-stage shallow bedded cyclic deposits of grainy carbonate material are preserved in the central area of the platform.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Anhydrite can plug reservoir pore space and dramatically reduce porosity and permeability where present. A few scenarios are assumed to represent anhydrite plugging starting from local plugging at well location to an extensive occurrence all over the aggradation deposits in Western Build-up area. Petrophysical properties such as porosity and permeability are modelled within regions defined by the seismo-stratigraphic study conducted by Eni (Borromeo et al. 2010) and the workflow which assumes that anhydrite plugging is patchy and localized only at flanks and in a ring shaped trend (Fig. 5). This ring shaped trend for the distribution of poor porosity related to anhydrite deposition is used in the latest geologic model and represents a most likely case which is in line with modern seismic interpretation.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">One example of the benefit of drilling a long horizontal well can be seen in Figure 7. It shows the results from the PLT along well KGK-1 located in the western part of the field and indicates where the producing zone is located. Note that the enhanced porosity zone occurs after 700 metres of lateral have been drilled and PLT flow occurs after 700 metres also. If the horizontal drain hole would have been only 700m long the best porosity intervals and intervals contributing to flow would have been missed. Another example of drilling long horizontal drains is well KGK-2 (Fig. 8) located in the south-west part of the field. PLT data indicate that the interval with about 50% contribution was encountered at about 800m along the drain. Again, if the horizontal drain hole would have been only 700m long the best flowing interval would have been missed.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr10">The reservoir in Karachaganak field is quite compartmentalised, especially in the flank areas, where most of the new sub-horizontal Object 3 wells are drilled. In addition, the impact of pressure baffles associated with the clinoform surfaces present in the field is quite significant as well. The pressure barriers associated with compartmentalisation in the flanks are evident on the pressure depletion trends from the wells located in the flanks (Figure 9), while partially sealing barriers created by clinoform surfaces are observed on XPT data (Figures 10). Under such conditions in the reservoir drilling wells with extended drain lengths increases the probability of draining the reserves from otherwise hydrodynamically restricted compartments.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr12">Well KGK-4 being one of the few wells with XPT pressure acquired from the sub-horizontal drain section has sufficient data to demonstrate the benefits of drilling wells with drains longer than 700m. In Figure 11 the presence of the pressure baffle associated with the clinoform surface is clearly captured as a discontinuity in the XPT pressure points normalised to a common depth of −5050m TVDSS. This pressure baffle was encountered at the MD of ~6081m (~1050m from well head coordinates), which means the well would not reach this baffle and would have only limited access to the reserves located on the other side of the clinoform if its drain length was limited to 700m. The PLT data indicates that approximately 45-55% of the total inflow contribution comes from the other side of the clinoform beyond the MD of 6081m.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr13">According to the results of the study (summarised in Figure 12), shortening the drain by ¼ and by ½ causes the incremental loss in the field liquid HC production of 2.0 and 5.7 MT, respectively. These losses are associated with reduced productivity of wells and with limited access to reserves that are available to the wells in the base case.</p><div id="link-12">
