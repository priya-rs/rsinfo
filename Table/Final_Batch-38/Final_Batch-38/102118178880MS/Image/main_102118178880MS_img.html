<p id="Ancr3">The purpose of this feature is to align the blade angle more with the resultant force from cutting the formation and thus improve the blade strength. Fig.1, shows the first principal stress comparison for a bit with zero lean blade on the left versus forward lean version of the same design on the right. Note that to add the lean to the design the root of the blades were shifted back to maintain tip geometry and thus loading conditions identical. As can be seen stress concentration at the blade root for the optimized blade geometry was reduced by at least 30%. This increases the safety factor against blade breakage and allows for taller and thinner blades without jeopardizing blade integrity.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">This was addressed with the flow guide feature which is a protrusion on the blade front that provides a conduit for the flow from nozzles to pass over the cutters. CFD indicated an average increase of 15-30% in both velocity (Fig. 2) and shear stress on the face of the cutters that helps with cleaning and cooling. The use of flow guide also reduces flow recirculation in the junk slot area which also improves cuttings evacuation. Full scale pressurized testing (Moslemi et al 2014) indicated an increase in ROP and reduction in bit balling for drilling in Catoosa shale, due to the use of the flow guide feature.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Therefore, extensive research was conducted on this topic leading to develop-ment of new modeling software to analyze the dynamic behavior of a PDC bit on bent motors with variable bent angles and stabilizer configurations. The software enables the designer to analyze and smooth the bit torque and WOB response to varying depth of cut and RPM ratios between the surface and downhole motor by making the required changes to the cutting structure (Fig. 3 and 4). The software is also capable of modeling the blade-formation rubbing under the eccentric bit motion which assists the designer to control the level of engagement between the bit and the formation using the available options.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr7">The Williston Basin is located in North Dakota, USA (Fig. 5). The Bakken formation consists of three sections: Upper Bakken, Middle Bakken and Lower Bakken. The Middle Bakken is composed of siltstone cemented with calcite, dolomite and silica while the Upper and Lower Bakken are composed of hard siliceous shales. The Middle Bakken reaches a maximum thickness of 90 ft near the center of the basin (Gaswirth et al 2013).</p><div id="link-5">
