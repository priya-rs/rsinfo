<p id="Ancr5">The reservoir is the T-sand, part of the lower Saramacca member of the Saramacca Formation of Paleocene age (Figure 3). It is composed of vertically stacked sand bodies deposited in a fluvial-estuarine and shallow marine environment and is encountered at depths varying from 900 to 1,400 ft (375-425 m) (Kartoredjo, et al. 2006). The main depositional direction is North-South. The reservoir is dipping towards the north and is limited by an edge aquifer in that direction; to the south the sands are pinching out which constitutes a stratigraphic trap. Several fault systems are present over the field.</p><div id="link-3">

One well from one of the pilot patterns and one well outside the patterns experienced severe water breakthrough and had to be shut-in later on.

<p id="Ancr16">The observation of the evolution of water salinity with time in the wells in Figure 2 revealed a relatively similar behavior for most wells; an example is presented in Figure 14. As can be seen in the figure, water salinity increased progressively right from the start of production in the example wells as in most of the wells in the area. Given the fact that the salinity of the formation water is in the 1,000 to 5,000 ppm range compared to 7,500 ppm for the Cretaceous formation water, it seems logical to suspect that the increase in water salinity was due to the influx of Cretaceous water into the reservoir and subsequent mixing with formation water.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr20">A Jordan plot over the pilot period (Figure 18) suggests that total fluid production is only approximately 50% of total injected fluid. Even taking reservoir expansion into account, this suggests that a significant portion of the fluid could be leaving the patterns. The fact that fluid was leaving the pattern area was expected due to the unconfined nature of the pilot patterns and was corroborated by the response to injection observed in wells far outside the pilot patterns such as wells 1M16 and 1M25 (Figure 6). As mentioned by Delamaide et al. (Delamaide, Moe Soe Let, Bhoendie, Jong-A-Pin, &amp; Paidin, 2016) it had been decided not to adjust pumping rates during the pilot and as a result the wells were not optimally pumped-off. This probably resulted in driving some of the fluids away from the pilot's producers.</p><div id="link-18">

<p id="Ancr21">The evolution of static pressure in the pilot area between 1991 and the present day is presented in Figure 19; there is a fair amount of scatter in the data, however, the trend is unmistakable. Initial reservoir pressure in the pilot area was approximately 421 psi and average reservoir pressure at the beginning of the pilot was approximately 181 psi. Between the start of production and the time when the pilot started in September 2008, a total of 1,217 Mbbl of fluid were produced (757 Mbbl of oil and 460 Mbbl of water); net withdrawal (taking into account the water influx from the Cretaceous and assuming all this water was produced) was thus 1,217 – 163 = 1,054 Mbbl. This net withdrawal resulted in a pressure decline of approximately 240 psi which corresponds to 0.228 psi/Mbbl.</p><div id="link-19">

<p id="Ancr22">Polymer production was calculated on a well-by well basis and is shown in Figure 20 together with produced injection water. Polymer production was calculated by interpolating the measurements of produced concentration and may thus be subject to error. As can be seen from the figure, while the volume of injected water produced increases with time, the percentage of produced polymer appears to remain stationary from the end of 2012, after seeing a first inflexion (downwards) in late 2011. This appears to approximately coincide with the first increase in injected polymer viscosity from 45 cp to 85 cp which took place in November 2011 and the second increase from 85 cp to 125 cp which occurred in February 2013.</p><div id="link-20">

<p id="Ancr23">Similarly, Figure 21 shows a plot of polymer production vs. cumulative polymer injected with and without well 1I25. Total polymer injected was estimated based on measured injected viscosity as well as polymer consumption. As can be seen from the figure, the increases in injected polymer viscosity seem to coincide with breaks in the slope of cumulative polymer production. Figure 9 shows that well 1I25 was producing high concentration of polymer and exhibiting an increase in produced concentration, contrary to most of the other wells in the pilot. For that reason, Figure 21 also shows a plot of cumulative polymer produced for the wells in the pilot except 1I25. The trend that was apparent in the first curve is even more obvious on this plot.</p><div id="link-21">

<p id="Ancr24">The main difficulty of the process was to determine for each pattern exactly how much of the incremental oil had to be attributed to which injection well; for instance, some wells in pattern 1N062 may have responded to injection in well 1M101 thus the incremental oil should be attributed to 1M101 instead of 1N062. Figure 22 represents the PUF for each pattern and Figure 23 is a summary of the pilot results including the PUF which takes into account the wells surrounding the pilot. Note that the PUF for the pilot is significantly higher than the PUF of each individual pattern because it includes the response of all the wells in the pattern, whereas the PUF for individual patterns includes only the response of the pattern wells due to the pattern injector.</p><div id="link-22">

<p id="Ancr26">During the course of the pilot, well 1N11 had to be shut-in due to high water-cut and high polymer concentration (Figure 24); breakthrough occurred in less than 3 months. In addition, well 1N01 which is outside of the pilot patterns (Figure 2) also experienced a sudden breakthrough and produced high polymer concentration, in fact much higher than most wells in the pilot (Figure 9). It was initially suspected that these events were linked to hydraulic fractures, however, after careful review, nothing allowed to attribute these behaviors to hydraulic fractures rather than to reservoir heterogeneity.</p><div id="link-24">
