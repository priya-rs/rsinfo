<p id="Ancr1">By 2015, Shell had CWEs operational in more than 40 of its largest assets (Van den Berg 2014, 2015), as shown in Figure 1. More than 55% of Shell’s production is now managed through CWEs. These CWEs target a single asset and provide effective collaboration between the office asset teams and the field operations staff. The key processes in these CWEs are production surveillance and management and maintenance processes including equipment and reliability monitoring.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">We need to have the surveillance and engineering teams and the remote control room co-located in the Shell offices in New Orleans. This requirement and the introduction of a fiber optic link to offshore caused Shell to rethink how to support the deepwater offshore activity from its broad network of teams in the region. This resulted in the creation of multiple Integrated Operations Centers (IOCs), a new design for work environments for technical workers and elimination of numerous silos. The progressing capability is shown in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

This brought together the operational surveillance and support, plus the field development activity supporting both assets in the Mars area of the Gulf of Mexico (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">Looking to the future, the leadership identified additional deepwater assets that would benefit from an IOC configuration (Fig. 5). The resulting IOCs covered several more floors in the New Orleans office. Two of these facilities, the Auger and Ursa platforms, had fiber-based communication in place, so it only required some IO improvements offshore to increase the collaborative links when their IOCs onshore were completed and came into operation.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Since 2013 PDO has embraced the live field collaboration aspect of Smart Mobile Worker and deployed specifically designed cameras at several sites (Fig. 6). This technology is used to collaborate between remote locations and centralized expertise via a real-time audio and video link to the Collaborative Work Environments (CWEs) in the field office and in PDO’s main headquarters. With the technology PDO is saving significant travel cost and reducing deferment by faster response to issues.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr10">Today the SMW devices connect wirelessly to the PDO IT network via pre-installed PDO Wi-Fi networks in production stations, buildings and wellheads or via a uniquely designed battery powered plug and play portable Wi-Fi access point (Fig. 10). The portable solution gives PDO the flexibility to connect the mobile devices from any wellhead in PDO. The PDO IT department is also working to support mobile phone technology such as LTE and 3G as connection mediums in the near future.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">The CWE has largely addressed these limitations, enabling connection between multiple locations (UAE, field location, Netherlands and India) during the well reviews (Fig. 13). The technology brings together Shell experts virtually, enabling sharing of high resolution well and reservoir data in real time among the review participants. In this way, the distributed review team has instant access and shares data repositories such as well data, production data, activity data, reservoir flow data, PI Historian etc. on the screens, often multiple datasets simultaneously.</p><div id="link-13">
