<p id="Ancr6">After 30 years of water injection, the water cut is up to 97 % and the main pay zone has suffered severe water flowing, as the remaining oil is scatterly distributed. The challenge of economic development is more distict and it is necessary to develop proper EOR technology and method. As shown in Fig. 1, From 2011-2015, NPF had been used in 16 well patterns and this paper will illustrate the field application and technical and economic effect evaluation of those 16 well patterns.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">To identify the macroscopic planar development of water-flowing channels of the reservoir, trace tests had been carried out on 7 injection well patterns, and the results showed a relative big direction and velocity difference of water flooding within the same well pattern with the slowest being 3.0m/d and the fastest being 11.3m/d. (As shown in Fig. 2.)</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">The comparison of same-time tested injectivity profile showed a large difference of interlayer water intaking, the layers with good absorption enhanced such ability whereas the layers with bad absorption worsened it. As shown in Fig. 3, when the Well X6-0-1 was tested in April 2010, the vertical employment level was 70.12% and layer 19,21, 22, 24, 25, and 26 showed the largest amount of water intaking. However, when a new test was carried out in Jan. 2011, though the employment level was still hight, those layers showed worsened water intaking with total percentage dropped from 50.99% to 19.10%.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr9">As shown in Fig. 4, since NPF slug had been injected from August 2011, it witnessed obvious increase of oil rate and decrease of water cut. The daily oil rate was increased from 97.8 ton in July 2011 of the blanked water flooding phase to a maximum of 148.65 ton in Febuary 2013, while the water cut was decreased to 95.43% from 96.68%. It’s worth mentioning that due to the influence of annual rainy season (summer), the production demonstrated a corresponding phenomenon of fluctuation.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">Such a process has demonstrated the rule of SMG NPF techniques: SMG experiences hundreds of millions of repetitions of: “Temporary plugging, breakthrough, re-plugging and re-breakthrough” in the reservoir and continuously diverts water into relative low-permeable or small pores to displace the remaining oil. Such a mechanism ensures a long lifetime of SMG and the production curve of typical wells as shown in Fig 5 has shown the same effect.</p><div id="link-5">
