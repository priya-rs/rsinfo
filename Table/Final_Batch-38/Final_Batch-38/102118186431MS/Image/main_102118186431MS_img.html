<p id="Ancr2">The recovery characteristics of each reservoir are expressed by their different values of ER and therefore the fw-R curves are different from each other. In Tong’s Curve, ER is taken as the module, and a group of fw- R curves can be plotted on a normalized coordinate paper as shown in Fig. 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr4">The rapid production decline in Well A was the response of pressure depletion. Based on the above analysis, the water injector was recompleted adopting a single-string adjustable eccentric water distributor. The technology enhanced water injection to the top flow unit while constraining injection to the lower two flow units. Both Well A and Well B responded to the injection adjustment immediately with a significant rise in production rates (Fig. 4). By May 2006, production rates of Well A and Well B had reached 566 BOPD and 725 BOPD, respectively, a significant increase from the pre-zonal water injection rates of 116 BOPD and 471 BOPD.</p><div id="link-4">

The water injection optimization activity resulted in a significant increase in production rate from 110 BOPD to 194 BOPD and a slight drop of water cut from 97.9% to 96.7% (Fig. 8). Average production rate per well increased from 28 BOPD to 49 BOPD. Ultimate recovery factor increased by 10% from 58% to 68% (Wang, 2011).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">In the example shown in Fig.9, the distributary channel reservoir presents a great lateral permeability contrast between channel and inter-channel sands. Injected water mainly swept oil along high-permeability channel sand, causing the oil well in channel sandbody to have high water cut and low oil production. The injected water had been ineffectively cycling from injector to producer. Instead, the producers in the interchannel sand were bypassed. Water plugging workovers were implemented in Well Z4-7 and Well Z6-6 to optimize sweep efficiency.</p><div id="link-9">

Among them, the two upper sub-units have low permeability of 160 mD and 290 mD, respectively; while the lower sub-units possess high permeability ranging from 1400 mD to 3500 mD (Fig. 10a). At the beginning of the study, the reservoir had recovered 32.2% STOIIP, was producing at 246 BOPD from 16 active producers with a water cut of 96.4%. Its ER was estimated as 36.3%. The significant permeability contrast between SII9 and SII10 results in substantial difference in recovery between the two reservoirs, which is 38.4% of STOIIP for the SII10 reservoir and 22.6% of STOIIP for the SII9 reservoir.</p><div id="link-10">

Compared with the forecasted performances of conventional waterflooding through reservoir simulation, oil rate by cyclic water injection is generally higher than that by conventional water flooding.
