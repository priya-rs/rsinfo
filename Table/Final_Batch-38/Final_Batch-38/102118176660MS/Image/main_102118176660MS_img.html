<p id="Ancr1">The same problem exists with GCF and in case of downhole sampling with self-contained downhole samplers. The near-wellbore formation pressure quickly drops below the dew point and fluid phase segregation starts in the wellbore. In other words, the period of stable fluid (single phase formation gas) inflow at GCF can’t be achieved as near-wellbore formation pressure quickly drops below the dew point. This is well illustrated by the phase diagram of gas condensate (Fig.1) taken from a fundamental work of Prof. J. McCain [12].</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Another group of problems is associated with changes in thermodynamic conditions in situ and in the production system. Temperature decreasing creates conditions for gas hydrate deposition, mainly in the tubing and surface piping system, which can result in system plugging and emergency production stop. In case of relatively shallow reservoirs in permafrost areas, gas hydrates are usually also accumulated in gas saturated beds above the gas reservoir. Gas hydrate layer destruction is associated with methane explosion funnels revealed on the Yamal, Taimyr and Gydan Peninsulas in recent years (Fig. 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">According to American companies [5], an average well production rate decrease during the first year of development for most shale gas plays is from 54% to 77%. According to statistical data on Haynesville field (USA), production volumes of 60 wells initially flowed through large size chokes reduced by 83% within the first year. At the same time, production volumes of wells that flowed through smaller chokes (5.5mm) reduced by 38% only. Proper choke sizes, i.e. optimization of producer well operation enables to extend the well production life and increase the total cumulative production by 30% (Fig. 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">A similar method of total flow measurement is also used in surface multiphase flowmeters [8, 9]. The Alpha VS (Venturi-Sonar) multiphase flowmeter is designed to provide two-phase flow rate measurements (gas – liquid) for wet gas flow streams. These are generally flow streams with greater than 90% gas volume fraction (GVF). Full three phase flow measurement can be achieved by adding a Red Eye® MP infrared water cut meter. A typical configuration for an Alpha VSR multiphase meter can be seen in Figure 4.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Real time optimization of multi-stage fracturing during shale play development requires measuring of separate fractures (Fig. 7). Unsteady character of the shale play production process results in inappropriate logging data. Continuous real time data updating and analysis is necessary for determining the contribution of separate fractures in the total production. Several sensors (P, T), DST system along the whole wellbore length and a surface flowmeter are installed in the well for this purpose. These data are acquired by Field Office operating intellectual field support system and processed using a special algorithm [20].</p><div id="link-7">

The technology of oil and associated gas desulphurization [21] is also conceptually applicable for gas condensate refinement (Fig. 8). This technology is compatible with process solutions for preliminary processing of oil and gas condensate. It should be emphasized that hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans removing from oil and associated gas may be performed within a single process flow diagram.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr10">The chart of gas condensate processing is shown in Fig. 10. Stabilized condensate (or furnace oil) enters the recovery unit, where it is heated to 80°C. Light fractions (C2-C6) after evaporation proceed directly into the separator, while heavier liquid fractions preliminarily pass through a catalytic unit, where their cracking takes place. The mixture gas-liquid separation is performed in the separator. By means of cooling the liquid is separated into corresponding storage tanks for diesel oil, lubrication oil and gasoline. The gases enter the gas-distributing unit.</p><div id="link-10">
