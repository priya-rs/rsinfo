<p id="Ancr9">According to that preliminary assessment, the minimum flow rate was estimated as 300 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) with a constant pressure at the outlet of export pipeline of 1100 psig (pounds per square inch, gage). A reduction in required inlet pressure of the pipeline, while maintaining the expected gas flowrate at referred outlet pressure, would increase the operational life of the production well and effectiveness of the well exploitation. Initial parameters of pipeline are given in Table 1. The three Norte de Paria fields (Mejillones, Patao, Dragon), shown in Fig. 1, are defined as dry gas fields; i.e., produced gas does not contain or contains small proportion of condensate and other reservoir liquids. Average water depth of the field is 100 m.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr14">A bar chart is constructed to perform more meaningful analyses (see Fig. 5). It is clear that inlet pressure has to be higher at small diameters and it should decrease by increasing the internal diameter. Trend line shown in Fig. 5 clearly describes this fact. Controversially, liquid holdup is at minimum degree with minimum pipe internal diameter and then, it rises as the diameter increases. Therefore, the optimal pipe diameter should represent a trade-off between both minimum inlet pressure and minimum holdup. Pipes with diameters 24, 26 and 28 inches led to low inlet pressures with a much lower liquid holdup than the initial gas pipeline configuration.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr18">A nominal diameter of 26 inches with wall thickness of 0.688 inches was chosen. These values correspond to industrial pipeline with internal diameter of 24.624 inches (Megyesy, 1997), which is comparable with theoretical value of internal diameter of 24 inches obtained from the analysis. Erosion thickness is not included since the velocity-to-erosion limit ratio is always below unity, with a maximum of 0.246, as shown in Fig. 9.</p><div id="link-11">

Theoretically, this case could be upgraded further. As an alternative solution, a pipeline multi-sizing approach is suggested. Figures 11 and 12 present results of the multi-sizing approach. Optimal combination of diameters led to a needed inlet pressure of 1247 psig (86.96 bars), which has not significant difference with previous optimization initial pressure of 1273 psig.
