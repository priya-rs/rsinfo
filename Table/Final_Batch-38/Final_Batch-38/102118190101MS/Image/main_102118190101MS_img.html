<p id="Ancr2">The Lost Hills field is located about 45 miles northwest of Bakersfield (Figure 1). The Lost Hills field was discovered in 1910 and hydraulic fracturing was introduced in late 1970s. Water flooding was introduced in 1992 and it has become the main production method. The main reservoir rock type is diatomite which is formed by the accumulation of diatoms, single cellular organisms. The average pay thickness is about 800 ft to 1,000 ft and the depth to the reservoir base is about 2,000 ft. The reservoir comprises three sub-rock types, siliceous diatomite, sandy diatomite, and clean diatomite based on its mineral contents.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr3">In simple explanation, what SVM does is to build a hyperplane or set of hyperplanes which separates data into separate groups (classification) or forms regression line (hyperplane is a subspace of one dimension less than its ambient space, i.e. a plane in 3D space). Figure 2 shows the example of classification in 2D space. The red line is a hyperplane and it is set to have the maximum gap between two classes. Data vectors in circles are border-line members and are called support vectors. When it is hard to build a hyperplane as shown in Figure 3, data is mapped into a higher dimensional space where a hyperplane is found. This mapping is done using a kernel function. Among various kernel functions, Gaussian function (radial basis function) was used in this study.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr8">Figure 7 shows spatial distributions of producers in Lost Hills. Blue squares represent Class 0 producers and green circles are for Class 1 wells. The wells in the periphery of the reservoir tend to be in Class 0 and the inner producers are more to be in Class 1. It is well aligned with that the reservoir quality in the inner area is better than the outside of the reservoir in terms of oil saturation, porosity and sand thickness. Normalized first year oil production rates, proppant, reservoir quality, and slurry changes against hydraulic fracturing dates are shown in Figure 8. Since 2013, there are few Class 1 producers even though the reservoir quality (SoPhiH) does not change compared to the previous years. The main reason for this reduction is the result of smaller hydraulic fracturing job size. The average amount of proppant and slurry volume after 2013 is about a half of the previous years’. Initial production (IP) after 2013 decreased more than the nominal decline rate. Smaller hydraulic fracturing job size may be one of the reasons contributing such IP reduction.</p><div id="link-7">

Regularization parameters were determined using the grid searching method to prevent over-fitting. Training and testing accuracies are 0.997 and 0.987, respectively. To estimate the sensitivity of input attributes, impact factors were calculated using the method suggested by Yeten et. al. (2005). Pseudo pareto chart is shown in Figure 11. In the figure, it should be in mind that the magnitude of impact factors do not have any physical meaning. Impact factors only tell which attribute has relatively more impact on the model. As we observed from the K-means clustering analysis, completion attributes (proppant and slurry) are the top two highest impact attributes on the trained SVM model.</p><div id="link-11">
