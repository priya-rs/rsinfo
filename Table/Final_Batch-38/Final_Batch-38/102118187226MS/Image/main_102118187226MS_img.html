<p id="Ancr7">The numbers of active oil and gas wells in the Eagle Ford are summarized in Table 1. Oil production in the Eagle Ford is an important part of shale oil production in the United States that has controlled global oil supply and prices over the last six years, see Fig. 1. Therefore, strategically, it is of utmost importance to have predictive models of shale oil production that go beyond the ad hoc hyperbolic decline curves and statistical studies. Here we attempt to satisfy parts of this strategic requirement.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr8">To fix ideas, let’s consider a typical black oil well in the Eagle Ford play, Texas. The typical horizontal well length is 1500 m (5000 ft), there are 12 stages with 4 clusters each, and we assume for the time being that there is one equivalent hydrofracture per stage with the tip-to-tip length, 2L = 400 m; and height, H, equal to the formation thickness. The hydrofractures are spaced every 2d = 100 m. For a cartoon of an idealized horizontal well, see Fig. 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr13">Since ultimate oil recovery in a shale is of the order of 10 saturation percent, flowing gas develops only in the near-fracture regions where average reservoir pressure falls down to just above 1500 psi, and the saturation change of oil is larger than 15 - 20%. This means that for a long time and in most of the pore space, gas remains dissolved in oil in the regions of the reservoir above the adjusted bubble point pressure, Pʹb. Below Pʹb, typical compressibility of trapped gas bubbles is shown in Fig. 7.</p><div id="link-7">

P50 is the median of the distribution with equal likelihoods, while P10 denotes a 10% probability that true RF will be larger than P10.

<p id="Ancr22">The cumulative mass produced by all wells, along with the corresponding number of the wells, are plotted vs. time on production in Fig. B2. During the first four months, there was only one well contributing to the production. Later on, more wells were drilled, resulting in the cumulative total oil mass curving up parabolically, until the maximum well count reached 65 wells. Naturally, as the reservoir pressure declines, the rate of oil production of each well must decrease with time, resulting in the cumulative oil production that curves down.</p><div id="link-16">
