<anchoringText id="Ancr7">The numbers of active oil and gas wells in the Eagle Ford are summarized in Table 1. Oil production in the Eagle Ford is an important part of shale oil production in the United States that has controlled global oil supply and prices over the last six years, see Fig. 1. Therefore, strategically, it is of utmost importance to have predictive models of shale oil production that go beyond the ad hoc hyperbolic decline curves and statistical studies. Here we attempt to satisfy parts of this strategic requirement.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr8">To fix ideas, let’s consider a typical black oil well in the Eagle Ford play, Texas. The typical horizontal well length is 1500 m (5000 ft), there are 12 stages with 4 clusters each, and we assume for the time being that there is one equivalent hydrofracture per stage with the tip-to-tip length, 2L = 400 m; and height, H, equal to the formation thickness. The hydrofractures are spaced every 2d = 100 m. For a cartoon of an idealized horizontal well, see Fig. 2.</anchoringText>

The exterior hydrofractures at the left- and right-hand end of the well drain the reservoir volume beyond the volume spanned by these hydrofractures and the length of the lateral. The hydrofractures are perpendicular to the wellbore. The flow of oil and gas (red arrows) is horizontal and perpendicular to the fracture planes. Once inside the hydrofracture, the fluids flows more or less radially into the well perforations connected to each hydrofracture. The permeability of a propped hydrofracture is infinite in comparison with the effective permeability of the rock matrix and natural fractures feeding the fluids into this hydrofracture.</caption>

<anchoringText id="Ancr13">Since ultimate oil recovery in a shale is of the order of 10 saturation percent, flowing gas develops only in the near-fracture regions where average reservoir pressure falls down to just above 1500 psi, and the saturation change of oil is larger than 15 - 20%. This means that for a long time and in most of the pore space, gas remains dissolved in oil in the regions of the reservoir above the adjusted bubble point pressure, Pʹb. Below Pʹb, typical compressibility of trapped gas bubbles is shown in Fig. 7.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr21">Fig. B1 shows 71 oil wells that are connected to the same pipeline and reported as one lease production record assigned to a well located at the border between the Dimmit and La Salle counties. The actual production data have been carefully tabulated and analyzed. We have found that these 71 wells span the bottom-hole area of 10,500 acres.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr22">The cumulative mass produced by all wells, along with the corresponding number of the wells, are plotted vs. time on production in Fig. B2. During the first four months, there was only one well contributing to the production. Later on, more wells were drilled, resulting in the cumulative total oil mass curving up parabolically, until the maximum well count reached 65 wells. Naturally, as the reservoir pressure declines, the rate of oil production of each well must decrease with time, resulting in the cumulative oil production that curves down.</anchoringText>
