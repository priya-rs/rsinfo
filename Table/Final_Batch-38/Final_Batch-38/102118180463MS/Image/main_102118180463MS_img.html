Developed areas are shown in dark blue. With initial production dating from 1985 and a moderate development pace, viscous oil has experienced technology waves in drilling, completion, and EOR capability.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr7">Oil quality and distribution is complex, but substantial data reduces risk of prediction. Oil viscosity controls include initial charge quality (typically ~28 API oil gravity), biodegradation (that reduces API gravity), and formation temperature. Bacterial oil biodegradation occurs with increased access to water and with decreasing temperatures at shallower depths, starting at temperatures lower than 80°C. Schrader Bluff oil API gravity and viscosity regionally improves with depth and temperature (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

Although reliable, this strategy had relatively low oil rate (&lt;400 bopd/producer) and low pattern waterflood rates. Producer drilling transitioned to horizontal single or multiple-lateral completions starting in 1998, significantly increasing oil rate (1000 to 3000 bopd/producer) enabling development to restart. Total well count increased markedly through 2010 (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr13">Sand production is a constant aspect of production with slotted liner horizontal completions often leading to shorter than expected pattern life (Figure 10). Determining the root cause of sand production and the mitigation methods are a critical need for any future EOR program. Healthy waterflood patterns with long life and improved flood rate are key objectives for any EOR process. This geomechanical rock strength related issue then leads to sand control considerations.</p><div id="link-10">

As shown in Figure 13, global analog waterfloods between 10 to 150 cp fields (small blue circles) typically achieve expected ultimate recovery of 30% at 2.0 hydrocarbon pore volumes injected (HCPVI), with some fields realizing 45% oil recovery at 4.5 HCPVI.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr19">The Schrader Bluff Analog Quilt shown in Figure 16 based on global analogs is categorized by oil viscosity and KH (md-ft). Lower viscosity (Vo) and higher KH are a sweet spot for PF and ASP as enhancements to base waterflood. Injectivity is a key issue for polymer, so polymer and ASP are not applied globally in higher oil viscosity reservoirs. For similar economic reasons, waterflood is thought to be limited to &lt;600 cp in the Schrader Buff. Regional viscosities shown in Figure 5 can be used to estimate which recovery process or processes may be prospective.</p><div id="link-16">

Solid lines reflect continuous polymer injection while dashed lines reflect a 0.42 HCPV polymer slug followed by water. A polymer concentration that delivered 15 cp fluid was selected since the next step to 30 cp only delivered approximately 1% incremental recovery.

<p id="Ancr29">Comparison of waterflood and liquid CO2 flood results on the basis of RF versus HCPVI is shown in Figure 26. The reference case for liquid CO2 was sand control using open hole gravel pack (OHGP) and OBa (B-sand) “no thief” zone treatment. Waterflood was used for 5 years prior to the start of liquid CO2 injection, after producing WOR was greater than 1.0.</p><div id="link-26">

<p id="Ancr30">In concept, liquid CO2 floods in Alaska’s viscous oil could be a major customer for a CO2 supply to capture this EOR benefit. At full development, most CO2 could be recycled within the viscous oil developments and would therefore require a new, dedicated, corrosion resistant viscous oil facility (Figure 27). Tests show that “impure” 95% CO2 / 5% methane does not significantly degrade recovery, thus the facility would not need to generate a pure CO2 product for produced gas re-injection.</p><div id="link-27">
