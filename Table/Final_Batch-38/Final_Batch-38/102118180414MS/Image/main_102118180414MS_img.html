<p id="Ancr1">Well completion techniques include both stimulated and unstimulated openhole and pre-perforated liners, to a myriad of modern multistage hydraulic fracture completions. Current completions typically include a 10,000 ft horizontal leg drilled through a continuous pay zone and propped hydraulic fracture stimulated in 20 to 100 mechanically isolated compartments. To date over 10,000 completions have been executed in the Bakken/Three Forks, with the geographic extent shown in Fig. 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">As a result of enhanced quality control of developed macro datasets, a true 92 comparative recompletions have been identified, with 49 reentry and 43 refracturing efforts. The remaining difference (and large amounts of previously categorized refracturing treatments) actually exist as problem-well remediation cases. As the budgets to execute within these three categories have reported as much as a 26-fold variance in recompletion cost, a strict comparison of these individual bins will be used in this analysis. Fig. 2 is a map geospatial showing the sample refracture and reentry wells in the dataset.</p><div id="link-2">

The production metric is 12-month BOE divided by the oil-to-liquid ratio. Gangiredla and Westacott (2014) presented this quantum as a uniform measure of induced flow capacity across a discontinuous oil-to-liquid ratio within the Williston basin Bakken/Three Forks play.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr11">Fig. 5 had a higher completion and stimulation intensity than Fig. 6, as illustrated in Fig. 3. The post refracture production for Fig. 5 is far more prolific than Fig. 6, providing evidence that merely choosing to refracture a well based upon initial completion design is a naïve approach. Rate transient analysis can provide an inherent measure of the completion effectiveness. One useful indicator of the flow regime within the reservoir is the slope of log-log rate versus time plot, as were shown in Figs. 5 and 6 and later in Figs. 7 through 11.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr25">In Fig. 25, a cross validation of post recompletion production to the first 12-months of production is shown. Fig. 25 suggests wells that are initially good performers trend toward higher post recompletion production. A common perception in the industry is to add production to underperforming wells by recompleting.</p><div id="link-25">
