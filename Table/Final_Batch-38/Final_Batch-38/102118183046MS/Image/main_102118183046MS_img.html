<p id="Ancr3">The seismically defined structure is an elongated low relief structure on a NW-SE trend. This field is structurally complicated and highly faulted which then led to compartmentalization of the field into separate fault blocks with different fluid contacts. The fault blocks are defined as Proven, Probable, and Possible as portrayed in Figure 1.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">In 1993, an early production scheme (EPS) was started to gather production data in order to identify the main uncertainties and test the feasibility of the full field development. The field produced oil and gas from 1993 to 1999. Monitoring the average reservoir pressure against cumulative production would indicate an average initial reservoir pressure of x090 psi with a range of +/- 75 psi at a datum level. During the years of production, a number of pressure build-up tests (PBU) for the producers and static bottom hole pressure tests in the observer wells had been taken. The results of those tests are given in Figure 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">The main hydrocarbon bearing reservoir in the field is a heterogeneous carbonate reservoir and is characterized by its marked vertical facies changes wackestone/ mudstone in the lower part while grading upward into foraminiferal grainstone/packstone. Based on the lithology variation, the reservoir could be subdivided into seven facies units. The reservoir represents a regressive depositional sequence starting with low energy (the LM facies) and ending with shallow marine high energy shoal deposits of the RO facies. The facies identified are from top to bottom RO, Ml, R1, M2, R2, M3A and LM as shown in Figure 3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Porosity. Twenty-six (26) cores with a total length of 951 ft were cut within the reservoir from ten (10) wells. The overall core recovery is around 68%. Routine core analysis was performed on plugs taken at regularly spaced intervals of one feet. In general, the core plugs porosity is matching with log porosity after overburden pressure correction except on the upper part of reservoir due to heterogeneities. The degree of compaction and subsequent formation of stylolites down flank is considered to be responsible for the thickness reduction and the deterioration of the average porosity towards the flank (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">For the scope of this work, the evaluation is mainly focused on the proven blocks and for this paper we would like to highlight the approach followed to derive the poro-perm relationships. Porosity/permeability relationships, corrected for overburden pressure, have been derived from routine core data for every subzone. This has been applied to log derived porosity to obtain permeability in the non-cored sections using neural network. With the limited amount of available data, utilizing the neural networks approach had improved the data representation compared to conventional approaches, as can be clearly observed from (Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr28">The final optimized subsurface locations are shown in Figures 21 and the simulation results Figures 22-26. Based on the prediction runs, developing the gas cap seems promising and in line with the other new existing conditions of low oil prices and increasing gas demand. Therefore and given all the circumstances, the development mindset is adapted towards the gas cap development, after it was originally set on oil development. Yet, the dynamic model is constructed with advanced tracking in order to identify and maximize the condensate and gas production from gas cap also to assess the future opportunities of targeting the bypassed hydrocarbon.</p><div id="link-26">
