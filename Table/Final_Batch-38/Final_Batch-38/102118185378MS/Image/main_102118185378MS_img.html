<p id="Ancr1">The Lanwa-Balol-Santhal Field Complex is a ~30 km long and 1-2 km-wide, heavy-oil (13-17 °API) belt located in the northern Cambay Basin, NW India (Plate-1). Balol field, a part of this complex, was discovered in 1972 and put on stream in 1985.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Field is about 13 km in length from South to north &amp; 1 km wide. Kalol formation of the Eocene age is the hydrocarbon bearing formation. The average depth of pay sands is around 1000 m &amp; dipping 3 to 5°. The structure is a homocline dipping towards the east. The field is divided into different fault blocks by NNW-SSE curvilinear faults (Plate-2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">With the application of this process, oil production from Balol field increased from 300 tpd (1997) to about 700 tpd in 2003 with corresponding reduction in water cut from 80 % to about 55 %. The process was very effective in terms of sustained combustion and increase in oil recovery from envisaged 13 % (primary) to 19 % of OIIP for field &amp; 22 % of OIIP of targeted sand (KS-I) as on date. Plate-3 indicates the improved production performance of EOR affected well and Plate-4 indicates the overall performance of the field.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr5">The performance of the process was different in different sector depending on the pay thickness &amp; the oil viscosities. The oil recovery is 54 % of OIIP in southern part of the field where thickness and oil viscosity are moderate (Hp ~6-8 m and viscosities 150-400 cP) as compared to the oil recovery of only 5 % of OIIP in northern part where thickness and viscosity are high (Hp ~20-22 m and higher oil viscosities 800-1000 cP). Plates-5 &amp; 6 indicates the performance of these two sectors respectively. Poor EOR recovery in northern sector was a great concern. Various attempts viz. reduction in spacing between injectors and producers through infill drilling and drilling of horizontal wells were made to improve the ISC performance in this sector but there was not much success.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr7">Well#B was drilled as a replacement well of existing injector well#A. The distance between both the wells is around 13 m. The open hole log of the replacement well showed flue gas charging only in top 6 m out of 20 m pay (Plate-7). Both the conventional coring and the side wall coring were carried out to get the actual information on burn efficiency in well#B. As the conventional coring is cost intensive and involves complication, only SWC was carried out in well#D.</p><div id="link-7">
