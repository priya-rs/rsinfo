<p id="Ancr1">R. Trebs oil field is located by the Barents Sea (Figure 1). A. Titov oil field, another major discovery, is located nearby to the south-east. Both assets are considered greenfields at an early stage of development. The main oil reservoirs are quite deep (about 4000 m), confined to the Lower Devonian and Upper Silurian carbonates (D1op+S2gr). The initial reservoir pressure is approximately 43 MPa and the reservoir temperature is about 90°C.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">It is anticipated that when gas is used as one of the displacement agents the rate of produced water will decrease and the displacement efficiency will change. Figure 5 illustrates how displacement efficiency changes with different timing of SWAG after implementing water flooding. This is the result of one of the dynamic flow simulations run for a sector of the field. Abrupt changes in water-cut (jumps of the curves) are associated with shutting-in of select highly watered wells. The timing of the water flood notably affects the water-cut and the recovery factor (RF).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">Another effect which was considered in the description of displacement efficiency under SWAG is the impact of the gas ratio in the injection fluid. In this case two auxiliary displacement curves are used – effective displacement which is used in the current performance of SWAG and corresponds to the base value for gas ratio in the flow, displacement under water flood subject to the current value of the recovery factor (Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr9">In the case of wells the boundary condition imposed by the reservoir is its pressure Pr. The bottom-hole pressure of the well PBH is estimated from the production (or injection) flow rate and well productivity (or injectivity) (Figure 9). Another boundary condition at the surface is the pressure in the field pipelines Pline – either in the gathering network or in the injection lines for pressure maintenance. The well flow rate at the wellhead pressure equal to line pressure determines the well potential.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The separators figuratively knock out oil, gas and water as individual phases (Figure 10). For the calculations of phase-to-phase equilibrium the compositional PVT-model is used based on the three-parameter equation of state (Peng, Robinson, 1976; Peneloux et al., 1982). To do this a computational module was developed with the help of the Michelsen algorithm (Michelsen, 1999; Whitson, Michelsen, 1989).</p><div id="link-10">

Apart from increasing the oil recovery factor SWAG also enhances or stimulates the oil production as seen from the lower water-cut (Figure 14). Significantly less volume of water is injected in SWAG with the same voidage replacement ratio as in water flood. The injected gas reduces the water mobility.</p><div id="link-13">

<p id="Ancr15">The GOR under SWAG may be times higher than the gas content of the reservoir oil – up to 700 m3/m3 (Figure 15). This increase is explained by the return gas coming to the producing wells. The changes in GOR values depend on the oil production and gas injection rates. During field development the ratio of oil in the produced fluid decreases due to water-cut whereas the rate of the injected gas (considering the return gas too) decreases at a slower rate.</p><div id="link-15">
