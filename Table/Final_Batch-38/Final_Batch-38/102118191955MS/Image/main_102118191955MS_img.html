<p id="Ancr1">The Keshen gas field is not only difficult to exploit technically, but also has poor ecological environment and complex social environment. The environmental situation in the Tarim basin is extremely terrible. The surface environment of Keshen gas field is mountain and Gobi Desert, as shown in Fig. 1. Belonging to temperate continental arid climate, with more wind and less rain, the annual natural precipitation is less than 50 mm. Annual temperature difference is large, up to 49 °C in summer and in winter minimum temperature of −24°C. Keshen gas field is located in a region with wide area and sparse population, with little surface vegetation and seasonal rivers. Most areas are not suitable for human habitation. Therefore, the social foundation that can be relied on is weak, the living environment is poor and the ecological environment is fragile.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">The process scheme of harmless acidizing (fractuing) fluid was established. In order to solve the problem of pollution to the environment and waste water resources caused by the direct discharge of acidizing (fracturing) fluid, the target is to reinject and reuse the backflow fluid, with reference to the water quality index of the injection, the water quality index of the dispensing liquid and the performance index of fracturing fluid. We established the acidizing (fracturing) backflow fluid injection treatment method and the acidizing (fracturing) backflow fluid reuse treatment method to achieve the efficiency of emission reduction, as shown in Fig. 2.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">In view of this phenomenon, the Tarim Oilfield Company invested 1.306 billion CNY to build a road network with a total length of 108 kilometers on the premise of ensuring efficient development of the Keshen gas field, as shown in Fig. 3. This road network not only connects single wells, field stations and other production places, but also connects to neighboring villages as open public roads for sharing with oil field traffic. During the construction process, the effective design minimized the transfer of heavy vehicles to transport production materials across villages and farmland, and ensured that residents’ lives and farm work were not disturbed.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">In the process of construction and transportation, construction materials and household necessities (e.g. toothpaste, shampoo, clothes, etc.) that are needed for the development project of Keshen gas field are basically purchased locally, increasing the income of local residents. At the same time, the operating areas in the gas zone have provided nearly 2,000 employment opportunities for local residents. In addition, minority and Han employees are encouraged to carry out a one-to-one help activity to strengthen the skills training and life care of ethnic employees, as shown in Fig. 4.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">As one of the important gas sources, Keshen gas field has supported the project of benefiting people from natural gas in southern Xinjiang, which has a pipeline of 2,400 kilometers and covers 41 counties (cities) in southern Xinjiang, enabling more than 4 million local people to start using natural gas, as shown in Fig. 5. Construction of Xinjiang southern Xinjiang natural gas project for the benefit of the people started in July 2010 and the pipeline network was put into operation in August 2013. The project mainly includes the construction of gas field capacity, natural gas pipeline network, emergency gas turbine power generation project and urban gas pipeline network.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">So far, 110,000 urban and rural residents have bid farewell to the "age of coal and wood," including 16000 households of rural users. Through the use of natural gas, the annual income of Hotan has increased by more than 200 million CNY. Taxis and buses in Kashgar city carried out comprehensive gas reform and used natural gas as a fuel source. The bus company has put 200 gas-electric hybrid environmentally friendly buses on the road. Through these measures, a quick turnaround was achieved, as shown in Fig. 6.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">The average productivity of a single well is more than 500 thousand cubic meters. In 2015, the total amount of taxes as well as the GDP of Baicheng County was twice as before, as shown in Fig. 7. Thanks to the initiatives we have taken, a harmonious development mode was established in Keshen. A win-win cooperation mode between the Oilfield Company and local communities has been established after a series of initiatives. This set a solid foundation for the sustainable development of Keshen gas field and also set an example for the development of reservoirs in remote areas.</p><div id="link-7">
