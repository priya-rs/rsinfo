<anchoringText id="Ancr4">To provide input data for scale and corrosion risk assessments planned for the Culzean Field (Figure 1) formation water samples were obtained from two locations in the Joanne Sandstone Member (4799m and 4800.5m TVDSS) of well 22/25a-10Z on this field and subsequently analysed. After an initial evaluation of the quality of the samples/analyses, it was estimated that the concentrations of Pb and Zn in the formation water were 218±11 mg/L Pb (172±9 ppm Pb) and 572±30 mg/L Zn (452±24 ppm Zn) (see Table 1).</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr5">The HTHP Culzean Field is located in Block 22/25a of the East Central Graben, UK North Sea (Figure 1). This gas condensate field was discovered by Maersk Oil North Sea UK Ltd with well 22/25a-9Z (Figure 2). The primary reservoir, and the focus of this study, is the Upper Triassic Joanne Sandstone Member of the Skagerrak Formation. The reservoir is made up of a sequence of interbedded fluvial sandstones and claystones with some rare siltstone horizons.</anchoringText>

<anchoringText id="Ancr21">Although the bulk crushed and leached fluid inclusion data have been derived from many fluid inclusions within the quartz samples, the quartz samples were selected to ensure that they only included fluid inclusions from a reasonably homogeneous population. The analyses are therefore considered by Yardley (2005) to be reasonably representative of the fluids present at the time the quartz was precipitated. The literature search identified a total of 483 analyses that could be used with Pb and Zn concentrations up to 69800 and 18100 ppm Pb and Zn respectively. These analogue waters are considered below when discussing the factors controlling concentrations of Pb and Zn in formation waters (see Figures 9–19; the symbols used on these figures are shown in Figure 8).</anchoringText>
