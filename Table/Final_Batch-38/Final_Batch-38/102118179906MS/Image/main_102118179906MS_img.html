<p id="Ancr4">To provide input data for scale and corrosion risk assessments planned for the Culzean Field (Figure 1) formation water samples were obtained from two locations in the Joanne Sandstone Member (4799m and 4800.5m TVDSS) of well 22/25a-10Z on this field and subsequently analysed. After an initial evaluation of the quality of the samples/analyses, it was estimated that the concentrations of Pb and Zn in the formation water were 218±11 mg/L Pb (172±9 ppm Pb) and 572±30 mg/L Zn (452±24 ppm Zn) (see Table 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">The HTHP Culzean Field is located in Block 22/25a of the East Central Graben, UK North Sea (Figure 1). This gas condensate field was discovered by Maersk Oil North Sea UK Ltd with well 22/25a-9Z (Figure 2). The primary reservoir, and the focus of this study, is the Upper Triassic Joanne Sandstone Member of the Skagerrak Formation. The reservoir is made up of a sequence of interbedded fluvial sandstones and claystones with some rare siltstone horizons.</p><div id="link-2">
