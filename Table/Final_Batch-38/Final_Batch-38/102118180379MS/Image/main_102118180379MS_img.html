<p id="Ancr7">Central to the Williston Basin, the formation is Late Devonian to Early Missis-sippian age and made up of five oil-bearing zones. The geologically unique top two oily layers, the Middle Bakken and the first bench of the Three Forks (commonly referred to as Three Forks 1), account for most of the Williston basin’s production. The Three Forks Formation is overlain by the Bakken throughout the central portion of the Williston Basin. Along the margins of the basin, where the Bakken is absent, the Three Forks is overlain by the Lodgepole Formation (Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

Along the margins of the basin, where the Bakken is absent, the Three Forks is overlain by the Lodgepole Formation (Figure 1). The Three Forks 1 has an average of 30.5 ft pay zone thickness, 65% oil saturation, and 6.9% porosity (Panjaitan et al, 2011). The wells referenced in this study are located in the Three Forks 1 layer, which is an interbedded dolomite and mudstone (Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr13">The size distribution and amount of components of the degradable composite fluid were optimized to create a low permeability plug with a minimum amount of material. Large particles are designed to pass through the perforations but be intercepted at the fracture entrance, while the smaller particles reduce the permeability of the formed plug (Figure 7). All the particles and fibers are made of degradable materials and require no additional treatment to be removed; thus, after the treatment, the solid materials degrade completely, opening the zone for production (Kraemer et al., 2014).</p><div id="link-7">

Material needs to hold its properties during fracturing treatment and then dissolve once reservoir begins heating back up. The bottom-hole static temperature for study wells varied between 230 to 235°F. Figure 8 shows largest particle degradation at 230°F.</p><div id="link-8">

<p id="Ancr20">This is due to the preferred fracture submitting first (at a lower pressure), following the ball seat. Once the diverter was pumped and the initially propagated fracture was plugged, the pressure increase of the second breakdown (during pill placement) was observed to be, on average, 50% higher than that of the seating of the ball in the frac plug. Results from this comparison on Study Well 1 are illustrated below in Figure 13.</p><div id="link-14">

<p id="Ancr21">This indicates that significant differences in instantaneous shut-in pressures from before to after the pill’s placement are the result of changes in closure pressure (Pcl) between the two fracture entry points (pre-pill and post-pill), which further supports the hypothesis that new fractures are being treated following the placement of the pill. The success criteria for ΔISIP were met for 83 intervals out of the total 102 intervals on which the diversion technique was implemented, an 81% success rate.

It can be seen in Figure 15 that the treating pressure during the fracturing stage after the pill (Stage 2) is significantly higher than that of the pre-pill pressure (Stage 1). The cause of this increase in pressure during the second fracturing stage (following the pill) could be twofold.</p><div id="link-16">

These results confirmed that the pill was in fact plugging the fractures that were accepting fluid during Stage 1 of the sequenced fracturing treatment, due to the distinct difference in acid relief exhibiting the “newness” of the perfora-tions following the pill’s placement.
