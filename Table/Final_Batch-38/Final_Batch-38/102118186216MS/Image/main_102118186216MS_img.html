<p id="Ancr3">RDG is situated at the northern end of the Central Basin High, a 40km long composite feature of elevated, en echelon N-S-oriented fault terraces in the southern Barmer Basin (refer Figure 1). The targeted pay zones consist of a poorly sorted clastic (Fatehgarh) interval on top of a stacked volcanic succession of thick lava flow cycles. The volcanic section is sub-divided into Basalt and Felsic formations based on the nature of volcanic activities during which the deposition took place (refer Figure 2). The average reservoir thickness is ~800m with ~300m of clastic and ~500m of volcanic rocks. The average depth of the reservoir ranges from 2,500 m TVDSS to below 3,500 m TVDSS. A typical log showing the formations encountered in an RDG well is depicted in Figure-3.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The greatest challenge in a low net to gross laminated reservoir is connecting all the available net reservoir storage (φ*h) and flow capacity (k*h) using the minimum number of frac stages. Limited entry technique was used in RDG to ensure that most of the productive pay was stimulated. Limited entry uses the pressure drop across the perforation to ensure fluid flow in all the intervals. For RDG, the required pressure drop for diversion was generally in the range of 700 to 1000 psi. The perforations/clusters were distributed to obtain the desired fracture dimensions for each zone. In some cases, separate individual fractures were generated while in other cases the fractures coalesced. Figure 4 contains two examples of the two simulation extremes.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">Multiple Frac stages (approx. 7-10 in a well) are required in each formation to connect the maximum kH, majority of them being in Basalt formation. Figure 7 depicts the percentage contribution of top most volcanic stage in a perticular well from the 1st MPLT survey conducted in that well. For example in well number U, 52% of the total well production is coming from that single top most volcanic stage. An important observation originated from the above plot, that approximately 45% of the cumulative production of the field is from that top most volcanic stages. This observation is attributed to the depositional structure of the field which is being futhur evaluated by the geologist and geophysicist. For upcoming campaign of 42 wells, frac design is being re-looked for this particular volcanic section so as to gain further from it.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr12">A scatter for proppant pumped per net pay vs PI for all the Basalt stages from the latest developed 15 wells were plotted as depicted in Figure 10. An essential observation was that in the stages with good PI values i.e. above 2000 Mscf/day, amount of proppant pumped was in the range of 8,000 – 16,000 lbs per meter of net pay. It was also observed that there are stages in which the amount of proppant pumped is quite high but still the PI values are not encouraging. It is now planned to limit the proppant pumped per meter of net pay for the stimulation of Basalt stages at 16000lbs in the upcoming development campaign of 42 wells. This will result in significant cost reduction as the cost of proppant and associated chemicals are approx. 65% of the total well construction cost (excluding drilling) for these monobore gas producers.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr13">M, AC and V are the wells which were drilled in Basalt formation only. First 2 MPLT surveys in these wells were conducted with a time difference of approximately 2 months. It was observed that the well PI’s have an increasing trend which is contrary to the trends observed in the others wells. The same is depicted in Figure 11 below. In well M, another MPLT survey was conducted which also showed a slighthly improved PI in comparision to the PI from the previous survey. This observation was attributed to better frac fluid cleanup with time as well as geological area in which the wells are situated. All these wells are situated in the Basalt mound region.</p><div id="link-11">

<p id="Ancr14">Figure 12 depicts a scatter plot for maximum petrophysical stress versus petrophysical net pay for all the frac stages of last 15 wells development campaign. Green circles and red hexagon on the plot represents the frac stimulation jobs which were placed successfully and unsuccessfully respectively. From this study, it was observed that 4 out of 5 jobs with net pay coverage less than 20 meters and maximum stress above 8500 psi were unsuccessful. For the upcoming 42 wells development campaign, it is planned that the frac stimulation in the stages which will lie in the above said region will not be attempted. Instead, another superior propective stage will be stimulated. This will reduce the number of unsuccessful frac stimulations which will aid in considerable cost savings in terms of daily rentals of the spread.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr15">Figure 13 depicts the range of surface instantaneous shut in pressure (ISIP) post frac stimulation observed in various stages of a well. It is evident from the figure that as we move from south west to north east in the field, the surface ISIP values increases. This is inline with the petrophysical stress values. In the three wells i.e. M, AC and V on the east side (only with green and blue colour) surface ISIP observed were maximum. These are the same wells which are drilled in Basalt formation only. 4 out of 16 frac stimulation jobs were prematurely called off due to high pressure in these three wells. These high stresses are attributed to the well location as these wells are located in the flank side of the Basalt mound region.</p><div id="link-13">
