<p id="Ancr1">Pressure data from across the field were normalized to a single reference well in order to evaluate the current pressure state within a given layer/sequence. The reference well should contain a complete stratigraphic section of producing intervals that are lithologically representative of the reservoirs in the field. The pressure/depth should be adjusted based on the pressure measurement‘s relative position within the reference layer (see Figure 1).</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr2">Normalization is a great tool to assess reservoir connectivity across faults. An example below shows how application of normalized and original data helped us understand the connectivity issue. Original data show similar pressures at similar depths across the fault which suggest communication between juxtaposed layers. In contrast, the normalized data clearly show that pressure is different within a given layer across the fault, thereby indicating measurable displacement (see Figure 2).</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Assessment of available data shows significant variation of pressure both spatially and in time. Wells were grouped by area and the year in which they were drilled. Four groups were defined: south, central, northeast and northwest. A closer look at wells in the south of the field reveals significant pressure discontinuity of ~1000psi across the OOWC. This barrier is observed at the same subsea depth across multiple different stratigraphic layers (see Figure 3).</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">The NW-SE cross-section reveals changes in pressure barrier ability to hold pressure. The pressure barrier is almost impermeable in SE-Central locations holding up to a 1000psi differential pressure. The pressure barrier in the NE is still observable, but it is only 100psi difference across it. Additionally, several layers were identified as baffles due to facies changes and/or dolomitization (see Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Startup of interior water injection (e.g. injection into hydrocarbon saturated area above pressure barrier) became a turning point for reservoir pressure dynamics. The reservoir pressure immediately began to recover as pressure support was brought directly to depleted zones. Initial reservoir pressure was restored 10-12 years after start of interior injection (see Figure 5).</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">Pressure dynamics of the water zone below the pressure barrier shows a significantly different story. Unlike the oil zone, pressure below the OOWC never dropped significantly, even in the northern part of the field where the barrier is less efficient (it drops 100-250 psi max). While at southern/central part of the field, pressure rose 150psi above initial due to injection and no communication to oil zone (see Figure 6).</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">Fluid rate, water cut and water salinity were used as criteria to evaluate the effects of peripheral injection wells on producers. In the northern part of the field we see a flowrate increase followed by water breakthrough. The central part of the field is distinctly different; the flow rate was unaffected by water injection and we continue to see water free production (see Figure 7). While there were relatievley few wells drilled in the southern part of the field at that time, new wells encountered unaltered oil saturation with no signs of water encroachment.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr8">Wells showing some effect were identified in between northern and southern/central zones. Interior injectors effect was limited here because of further distance from injectors and presence of the baffles that control vertical pressure/fluid communication (see Figure 8).</p><div id="link-8">
