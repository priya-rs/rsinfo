<p id="Ancr3">Well WI-01 was drilled and initially completed as dump-flood from aquifer Unit A into Unit D in 1977. In 1980 well was converted to single injector in Unit D after isolating aquifer with a 7″ scab liner. In 2004, well was shut-in due to high annulus pressure, and sidetracked to Unit F, re-completed as dual injector in Unit D &amp; Unit F. The 7″ liner was cement squeezed and tied back to surface. A location map (Fig.1) and a wellbore schematic (Fig.2), showing current status, are shown below.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr5">Spectral Noise Log is used to identify active flow units, differentiate matrix and fracture flow, detect behind-casing channeling or leaks in well completion. Multichannel spectral noise logging (SNL) tool has high-sensitive sensor to track noises behind multiple barriers. The interpretation of the Spectral Noise Logging data is based on amplitude-frequency analysis. The SNL is characterized by carrying out multiple lab tests and field studies which show noise frequency as a function of fluid movement in different medium and rock types. The noise frequency patterns are shown in the Fig.3.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">The well was logged after 72 hour's shut-in to acquire stabilized temperature. The tools were run in Long String under three conditions: Shut-in (both strings), injecting in the Short String only, and Transient (time-elapsed under shut in) conditions. A summary is shown in the Table below and in Fig.4. HPT was logged while RIH at 16.0 ft./min and the SNL was logged during POOH with stations every 3 feet.</p><div id="link-4">
