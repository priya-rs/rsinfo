<p id="Ancr5">Lago Agrio field is located in Sucumbíos Province, northwest of the Oriente basin in Ecuador (Fig. 1). The field was discovered in February 1967 with the drilling of the LGA-001 well, which reached a total depth of 10,175 ft and produced 2955 BOPD by natural flow from the Hollin formation.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">The field was put in production 1969; the major drilling activity was performed in 1970, in which 16 well were drilled. The official beginning of field production, however, was reported in April 1972. The field reached a production peak of 53,600 BOPD in November 1973 (Fig. 2) with 21 active wells, including 20 Hollin producers and 1 Lower T producer (LGA-021). Since this date, the production declined to stabilize at approximately 5,000 BOPD in 2005. The current rate to December 2015 is 3,504 BOPD with a 48% water cut.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr7">The current rate to December 2015 is 3,504 BOPD with a 48% water cut. Historically, some wells commingled production from Hollin and Napo T or Napo U; currently, an exhaustive revision and redistribution of production is underway.

<p id="Ancr8">Lago Agrio was primarily developed with vertical wells. To date in the field, 62 wells have been drilled, including 47 vertical, 11 deviated, and 4 reentries. There are currently 19 active wells in the field that are producing through three primary artificial lift systems: nine with a hydraulic pump (jet pump), eight with an electrical submersible pump (ESP), and two with a sucker rod pump. Fig. 4 shows the historical sequence of drilling in Lago Agrio.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr9">FEL is the method used to define a project under a general international guide of project management of capital investment. FEL includes six phases: visualization, conceptualization, definition, implementation, operation, and abandonment (Fig. 5). The first three phases of a project or VCD (visualizationconceptualization- definition) correspond to planning and project formulation stages, in which the final characteristics and the benefits of the project to the company are determined along with all necessary resources for implementation.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr11">The integrated analysis productivity workflow in the diagnostic stage incorporated stratigraphicstructural correlations to define the lateral continuity of the reservoir studied, their effect on production (using production history and bubble maps for the analyzed well and nearby wells), and decline analysis to calculate remaining reserves. Each well was evaluated in four potential reservoirs: Hollin, Napo U, Napo T, and Basal Tena. To diagnose the water sources, the analysis of the water/oil ratio and its derivate was developed using diagnostic plots (Chan 1995), and some cement bond logs and salinity values were used to validate the diagnosis (Fig. 7).</p><div id="link-7">

At this stage, 60% and 70% of absolute open flow (AOF) were used, rather than the vertical lift performance (outflow). Because the type of intervention proposed for the reservoirs was similar, petrophysical properties were an important input to estimate the initial rates. The estimated production was grouped by intervention type, as shown in Fig. 10.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr16">To address technical risk, a better scenario was selected for each well that would not eliminate the other scenarios considered to be opportunities for the intermediate plan. Wells with estimated production that exceeded 80 BOPD were analyzed in more detail; PTA and Class II cost were incorporated. By combining the technical and economic risks and uncertainties, the respective ranking stage by well was established. At the end of this project, 30 opportunities for intervention were conceptualized and ranked. Fig. 12 plots the 30 final scenarios generated and evaluated in each well, and the associated deterministic and probabilistic production.</p><div id="link-12">

<p id="Ancr17">Between approximately P5 and P90 values of production were obtained for seven interventions (approximately 1,900 BOPD, as shown in Fig. 13); well LGA-025, however, was tested in a new zone, but the results show very low permeability and, consequently, low oil rate. Well LGA-037 currently is awaiting further evaluation. Almost all workovers that were performed used hydraulic fracturing.
