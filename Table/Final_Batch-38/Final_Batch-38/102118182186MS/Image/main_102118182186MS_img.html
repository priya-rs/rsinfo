<p id="Ancr3">Rumaila Oilfield is one of the most giantest fields all over the world, which is located in southern Iraq (Fig. 1) and was discovered by Basrah Petroleum Company in 1953 (Ziad, 1988; Alsharan, 2003; Marius, 2009). This giant oilfield contains 3 major reservoirs, and this study focuses on a sandstone reservoir. This reservoir was producing without any energy supply until now, and the average pressure is declining significantly.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr4">The target reservoir was deposited in a transition environment ranges from upper delta plain to pro-delta and further to distal shallow marine, which is dominated by channel sand with great heterogeneity. This multi-layered sandstone is anticline reservoir with 2 crests located in the north and south respectively. The direction of the long axis in north part is N to S, and the direction of the long axis in south part is N-NW to S-SE (Fig. 2). The spatial distribution and scale of sand bodies varies significantly according to the evolution of depositional facies which resulted mainly by the fluctuation of relative sea level.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr5">Detailed sequence stratigraphic study has been done based on core, thin sections and well logs, which reveals that the target reservoir is composted by two third order sequence, and it can be further divided into 6 members and 15 zones according to higher level depositional cycles and its lithofacies associations (Fig. 3). The source area locates in the southwest, and the reservoir properties trend varies along this direction. Within the 6 members, sand bodies develop uneven because the change of relative sea level and lateral shift of facies, channel sand extend widespread in M3 because the drawback of shoreline, M4 and M5 has few channel sand developed within southern part of the field which correspond to the rise of relative sea level. The major reservoirs are Member 2 to Member 5 with the average thickness of 76m. For reservoir parameters, the average porosity is 18%, average permeability 194 md, and the oil viscosity is 1 cp with initial GOR 650 scf/bbl.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr6">Based on the selection criteria, 4 water flooding pilots are suggested, and the locations and stratigraphic correlations of different pilots are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that each pilot have its distinctive geological characteristic from good to poor respectively. In addition, based on the geological study, the reservoir has been classified as type A, B, C, and D, and the reserve percentage of type C &amp; D is used as an index to indicate the reservoir quality. The 3 pilots in the south represent good quality reservoir (19% Type C and Type D), medium quality reservoir (35% Type C and Type D) and poor quality reservoir (54% Type C and Type D for alternative) respectively.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr7">Fig. 5 shows the stratigraphic correlations of different pilots. The first pilot is located in the southwest part of the reservoir. Based on the stratigraphy correlation we can see that all members are developed in this area, and we believe the reservoir quality represent the medium for the reservoir, and the connectivity is very complex.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr8">As shown in Fig. 6, the thickness of Member 2 to Member 4 ranges from 6 to 8m, and only Member 5 exceeds 10 m, and the average permeability for Member 2 to Member 6 is 74 mD. In addition, all members are developed in this area, and most of them are relatively stable. Therefore, compared with other areas of the reservoir, this area represents the medium quality, and the productivity, injectivity,</p><div id="link-6">
