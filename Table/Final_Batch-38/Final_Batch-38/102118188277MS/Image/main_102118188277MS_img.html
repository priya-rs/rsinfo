<p id="Ancr2">Maintaining the voidage replacement ratio (VRR) has proved to be a significant challenge for Manora. Without water injection, the reservoir pressure declines rapidly, but in some reservoirs injection is constrained because of low injectivity and this affects the ability to maintain the reservoir pressure above the bubble point pressure of about 1200 psi. VRR is of particular concern in the CB A-10 sand, and that reservoir is the focus of this first case study. Figure 2 shows the ESP pump intake pressure (PIP) at the primary (and initially the only) CB A-10 updip producing well, Well-2P, together with the water injection rate into the downdip water injector, Well-4I, during the first 18 months of field production. The pressure decline prior to the start of injection clearly demonstrates the need for robust pressure support.</p><div id="link-2">

<p id="Ancr3">Well-4I is the only injector providing pressure support for this reservoir. Initial injectivity was extremely poor (less than 0.5 bbls/d/psi) and this was solved temporarily by using rig pumps to inject above frac pressure. Following this, injectivity could be maintained for several months at an acceptable level with the injection pressure available from the production system. However, the injectivity started declining from mid-September 2015, with VRR decreasing from 1.0 to 0.4. Figure 3 shows the historical production/injection balance and VRR.</p><div id="link-3">

<p id="Ancr4">An injection and fall off (IFO) test, run in May 2015 in conjunction with a production log, provided information that started to explain the poor injection performance. Figure 4 presents a diagnostic plot of the pressure fall off data, showing a skin of more than 100; this extraordinarily high skin is manifested by the separation of several log cycles between pressure (green) and derivative of pressure (red). In addition to the skin factor, the average permeability was found from this IFO to be only about 300 mD – less than one tenth of the average permeability around the updip oil producer, Well-2P. This relatively low permeability –found to be common to all the aquifers in the field – was something of a surprise because all of the appraisal well tests had been performed on the updip oil reservoirs, and consistently yielded multi-Darcy levels of permeability.</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr5">Consequently, acid treatments were designed in order to solve the scale precipitation problems, and acid stimulation jobs were performed in October 2016 and in June 2017. These treatments were at least temporarily effective in solving the Well-4I injectivity loss from calcite precipitation. From the Hall plot shown in Figure 5, the injection performance is seen to be enhanced by the acid treatments (as well as by the frac jobs): the decrease in slope of the Hall plot (black line in Figure 5) following the treatments is an indicator of improved injectivity.</p><div id="link-5">

<p id="Ancr6">After the first EB producers were drilled, the post-drill results showed shorter oil column heights than expected from the pre-drill seismic data. These shorter oil column heights suggested that the fault position, based on the initial seismic interpretation, needed to be shifted. The seismic data was therefore re-interpreted by integrating the post-drill well results. Figure 6 shows a before-and-after comparison of the Manora seismic dataset. The pink polygon shows the repositioning of the Manora main fault.</p><div id="link-6">

<p id="Ancr7">In both fault blocks, pressure transient analysis (PTA) has been extensively used as a tool to improve the understanding of reservoir architecture, and indicates the presence of sub-seismic faults in both fault blocks, as shown in Figure 7 and 8. The barrier distances are approximately 250 – 500 ft. These barriers, thought to be minor faults, channel the movement of fluids in the reservoirs into narrow pathways, contributing to early water breakthrough. The late time decline in the pressure derivative in Figure 7 is due to interference from another well producing from the same reservoir unit.</p><div id="link-7">

<p id="Ancr9">The A-20 Sand is sub-divided into three sub-units, the A-20-10, A-20-20 and A-20-30 Sands. Producers in these units were completed initially with "Smart" completions, as shown in Figure 9, in which the individual sub-units are isolated with packers and are produced into the tubing via inflow control valves (ICVs) whose opening and closing can be controlled from surface, and which are equipped with downhole pressure gauges (DHPGs) on both the reservoir side and the tubing side of the ICV. This allows the sub-units to be flowed and tested individually.</p><div id="link-9">

<p id="Ancr10">The problem of lateral channeling is compounded by vertical reservoir heterogeneity which leads to incomplete sweep. This is clearly illustrated by Figure 10, which shows the results of a production logging survey in Well-9I, an injection well in the CB A-50 Sands. Interpretation of the spinner response shows that nearly all of the injected fluid is entering a small section of the reservoir interval (which the open hole gamma ray suggests is not vertically connected to the other sand sub-units within the A-50 sequence). This indicates that the sweep efficiency is likely to be poor in the other reservoir sections.</p><div id="link-10">

<p id="Ancr11">Well-11P was initially perforated in the A-10 and A-50 sands. The well was worked over in December 2016 in order to add perforations in the A-20 sands, even though the well is in a down-dip location and these sands had already been produced by the up-dip producers since Nov 2014. The logging results (Figure 11) indicated the presence of bypassed oil due to lateral channeling and vertical heterogeneity, and the perforation interval was selected based on the resulting estimates of oil saturation in the A-20 sands. The unswept oil confirms the effect of the channeling and heterogeneity on the displacement efficiency.</p><div id="link-11">
