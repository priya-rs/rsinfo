<p id="Ancr3">The AA Field is a collapsed crest rollover anticline structure dissected by several synthetic and antithetic faults. The field is divided into 3 major fault blocks: Northern Block, Main Block and Block “E” (Figure 1). The field consists of several stacked hydrocarbon-bearing sands that were deposited in a deltaic environment in early to middle Miocene time; with fluvio-deltaic to shallow marine facies being represented at different levels in the field. In general, depositional strike is NW-SE sub-parallel to the field structure building fault with reservoir quality deteriorating towards the west6.</p><div id="link-1">

<p id="Ancr6">Following a reservoir simulation evaluation of waterflood potential in this reservoir, peripheral water injection commenced in 2002 via well Inj-01i located in SE of the reservoir (Figure 5). The eastern part of the reservoir responded positively to water injection from Inj-01i as the pressure rose significantly. However the western part of reservoir X01 did not experience pressure increase (Figure 4). A second injector, Inj-02i was completed in the NE of reservoir X01 and started injection in 2008. No positive pressure response was observed in the western part of the reservoir even after completion of Inj-02i (Figure 4).</p><div id="link-4">

<p id="Ancr10">The reservoir was acting homogeneously in terms of pressure from 1965 to 1994 (Figure 8). From 1994 three pressure trends developed in the reservoir: low pressure trend in the western part of the reservoir (X02_West), moderate pressure trend in the central part of the reservoir (X02_Central) and high pressure trend in the eastern part of the reservoir (X02_East) reservoir (Figure 9). This multiple pressure behavior is largely caused by the differential voidage withdrawal across the reservoir coupled with stratigraphic variation and internal faults in the reservoir.</p><div id="link-8">
